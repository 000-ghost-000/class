# use case

In software engineering, a use case is a narrative description of how a user (actor) interacts with a system to achieve a specific goal. It outlines the functionalities and features of the system from the user's perspective, focusing on the "what" rather than the "how."

Key Characteristics of Use Cases:

Actor-Centric: Use cases revolve around actors, which can be human users or external systems interacting with the software.
Goal-Oriented: Each use case describes a specific task or objective a user wants to accomplish using the system.
Scenario-Based: They outline a series of steps involved in achieving the goal, including successful interactions, alternative flows (e.g., error handling), and exceptions.
High-Level Overview: Use cases focus on user interaction and functionality without delving into the technical details of implementation.
Benefits of Using Use Cases:

Improved Requirements Gathering: Use cases facilitate clear communication between stakeholders by capturing user needs and expectations.
Enhanced System Design: By understanding user workflows, use cases help in designing a system that is user-friendly and meets their requirements.
Better Testing Strategy: Use cases provide a foundation for test case development, ensuring the system fulfills its intended functionalities.
Effective Documentation: Well-defined use cases serve as valuable documentation for future reference and system maintenance.
Elements of a Use Case:

Use Case Name: A concise title that describes the user's goal.
Actors: The users or external systems interacting with the system.
Preconditions: The starting state of the system before the use case begins.
Postconditions: The expected state of the system after the use case is completed.
Basic Flow: The main steps involved in achieving the user's goal.
Alternative Flows: Possible deviations from the main flow (e.g., error conditions, user input variations).
Exceptions: Unforeseen events or situations that might arise during the use case.
Use Cases vs. Other Techniques:

While use cases are valuable, they differ from other software development techniques:

Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs): DFDs focus on the flow of data within the system, whereas use cases focus on user interactions and functionalities.
User Stories: User stories are typically shorter and more informal than use cases, often expressed in the format "As a [user role], I want to [goal] so that [benefit]." However, both techniques capture user needs and goals.
