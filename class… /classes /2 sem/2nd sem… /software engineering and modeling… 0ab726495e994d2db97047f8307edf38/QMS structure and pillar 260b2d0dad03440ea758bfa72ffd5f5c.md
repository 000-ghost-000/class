# QMS structure and pillar

Software Quality Management (SQM) refers to a systematic approach for ensuring software products meet the desired quality standards throughout the development lifecycle. It encompasses processes, practices, and tools that aim to deliver high-quality, reliable, and functional software.

Here are the key elements of an SQM system:

- **Quality Planning:** Defining quality goals, establishing metrics, and outlining processes to achieve those quality objectives.
- **Quality Control:** Activities that focus on identifying and rectifying defects in the software. This includes code reviews, testing, and static code analysis.
- **Quality Assurance:** Processes that emphasize preventing defects from being introduced in the first place. This involves using best practices, conducting risk assessments, and employing a quality-focused development culture.
- **Testing:** A crucial aspect of SQM, involving various testing strategies like unit testing, integration testing, and system testing to identify and fix bugs before deployment.
- **Documentation:** Maintaining clear and up-to-date documentation on requirements, design decisions, test cases, and defect reports is essential for quality control and future maintenance.
- **Continuous Improvement:** An effective SQM system strives for continuous improvement by analyzing past projects, learning from defects, and refining processes for future releases.

**Benefits of a strong SQM system:**

- **Reduced Defects:** Early identification and rectification of defects lead to a more robust and reliable software product.
- **Enhanced User Satisfaction:** High-quality software translates to a better user experience, fostering user satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Lower Development Costs:** Catching defects early prevents costly rework later in the development cycle.
- **Improved Time-to-Market:** Efficient SQM processes can help streamline development and expedite software delivery.
- **Competitive Advantage:** High-quality software can give you a competitive edge in the market.

### pillar

A robust Software Quality Management (SQM) system is essential for building reliable and high-quality software. Here's a look at some of the key pillars that underpin an effective SQM system:

**1. Quality Planning:**

- **Focus:** Establishes the groundwork for ensuring quality throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
- **Activities:** Involves defining quality goals, identifying quality requirements, selecting appropriate testing strategies, and creating a test plan.

**2. Quality Assurance (QA):**

- **Focus:** Proactive quality measures implemented throughout the development process to prevent defects.
- **Activities:** Include code reviews, static analysis tools, unit testing, integration testing, and configuration management.

**3. Quality Control (QC):**

- **Focus:** Reactive measures used to identify and rectify defects in the software after it's developed.
- **Activities:** Encompass various testing approaches (functional, non-functional, regression), defect tracking and management, and corrective action implementation.

**4. Process Improvement:**

- **Focus:** Continually evaluates and improves the SQM system and development processes for better efficiency and effectiveness in achieving quality.
- **Activities:** Involve process analysis, performance measurement, implementing best practices, and incorporating lessons learned from past projects.

**5. Communication and Training:**

- **Focus:** Ensures all stakeholders (developers, testers, managers) understand the importance of quality, have clear communication channels, and are equipped with the necessary skills for effective SQM practices.
- **Activities:** Involve training programs, conducting meetings, maintaining clear documentation, and fostering a culture of quality within the development team.
