# programming practices

## programming-practices:

how to write down the program

### egoless programming:

use of comments(internal documentation)

- name of module
- purpose of module
- description
- original programmer
- modification
- programmer who modified with a description an why it was
modification

use of descriptive names

- pascal casing
    - first char is capital of every new word
- camel casing
    - first char is lower case rest all upper case of every new word
- upper casing
    - all letter in upper case

KIS(keep the code simple)

- avoide the use of complex block of codes that can be hard to be
understood by other coders
- readability of the code should be easy so that all the coders
working on that same project can understand the logic
- good documentation
- transpotability
- usability
- indentation

### approaches:

- top down programing → modular programing
- bottom up → most primitive operations
- structured →
- information

## CBSE(component based soft
engg.)

reuseable components

CORBA (common object request broker architecture)

### case study:

The system that pays workers has one basic input data flow, the
weekly timesheet, which originates from the source worker. The basic
output is the paycheck, the sink for which is also the worker. In this
system, first the employee’s record is retrieved, using the employee ID,
which is contained in the timesheet. From the employee record, the rate
of payment and overtime are obtained. These rates and the regular and
overtime hours (from the timesheet) are used to compute the pay. After
the total pay is determined, taxes are deducted. To compute the tax
deduction, information from the tax-rate file is used. The amount of tax
deducted is recorded in the employee and company records. Finally, the
paycheck is issued for the net pay. The amount paid is also recorded in
company records

Create a DFD for the above case:

### oops:

it is a programming model based on the concept of objects , object
contain data in the form of attribute and code in the form of method ,
in oop programmer define not only data type on data structure but also
the type of operation and function that can be applied to the
programming structure

### class:

a class is the definition of object with same properties and
attributes

### question :

- what is information hiding / encapsulation?
- diff between object oriented and procedural programming
- a supermarket needs to develop a following software to encourage
regular customer for this customer needs to supply his / her residence
address, tel. no. , driving license no. ,each customer who registers for
scheme is assign unique number “CN by the computer” a customer can
present his CN to checkout staff when he makes any purchase in this case
the values of his purchase is credited against his CN at the end of each
year the supermarket intends to award surprise gifts to 10 customers who
make the highest purchase over the year also it intend to give 22 carrot
gold coin to every customer whose purchase excided INR 10,000 the
entries against CN is reset on the day of every year after the prize
winner list are generated
