# testing

## Testing:

IEEE defines testing as the process of exercising or evaluation system or its component by manual or automated means to verify it satisfy requirements or to identify difference between expected or actual result

### levels of testing:

- unit testing
- integration testing
    - big bang method
    - top down integration
    - bottom up integration
    - mixes/hybrid approach
- system testing
    - functionality
    - performance
    - security
    - portability
- acceptance testing
    - alpha testing
    - beta testing
- regression testing

### category of testing:

- black box testing/functional testing
    
    Black box testing, also known as behavioral testing, focuses on validating the functionality of a software system without diving into its internal workings. Here are some key points to remember:
    
    - **Focus:** It examines the system's behavior from an external user's perspective.
    - **Input & Output:** Testers provide specific inputs and observe the system's outputs to ensure they match expectations.
    - **Requirements:** Test cases are derived from software requirements and specifications.
    - **Benefits:**
        - Identifies usability issues, compatibility problems, and overall system behavior.
        - Simulates real-world user experience.
        - Requires less knowledge of the internal code.
    - **Techniques:** Common techniques include:
        - **Equivalence Partitioning:** Dividing inputs into valid and invalid categories.
        - **Boundary Value Analysis:** Testing inputs at the edges of expected ranges (e.g., minimum and maximum values).
        - **State Transition Testing:** Checking system behavior across different states (e.g., logged in vs. logged out).
        - **Error Guessing:** Anticipating potential errors and creating test cases to trigger them.
    - **Levels:** Black box testing can be applied at various levels:
        - **Unit testing:** Individual units are tested in isolation (not strictly black box, but can be used with some black box techniques).
        - **Integration testing:** Ensures different modules work together properly.
        - **System testing:** Tests the entire system as a whole against requirements.
        - **Acceptance testing:** Verifies the system meets user needs before deployment.
    - **Limitations:** Black box testing alone may not uncover internal errors or complex logic issues. It's often combined with white box testing (examining internal code) for a more comprehensive approach.
- white box/glass box/structural testing
    
    White box testing, also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, or structural testing, examines the internal workings of a software application. Unlike black box testing, which focuses on functionality from a user's perspective, white box testing delves into the code itself.
    
    all internal operation are perform according to specification and all internal components have been exercised  
    
    all logical parts of software is tested the test cases exercise specific sets of condition and loops
    
    Here are some key points to remember:
    
    - **Target:** White box testing focuses on code structure, logic flow, and data manipulation within the application.
    - **Benefits:**
        - **Thorough Testing:** It can identify errors related to logic flaws, incorrect calculations, or missed code paths.
        - mutation testing:
        - **Improved Code Coverage:** Helps ensure all parts of the code are exercised during testing.
        - **Early Detection:** Bugs can be caught earlier in the development process.
    - **Requirements:** Testers need a good understanding of the application's code and programming language.
    - **Techniques:** Common white box testing techniques include:
        - **Statement Coverage:** Ensures every line of code is executed at least once.
        - **Branch Coverage:** Tests all possible execution paths through conditional statements (if/else).
        - **Decision Coverage:** Tests all possible combinations of conditions in decision points.
        - **Path Coverage:** Executes all possible execution paths through the code.
        - **Mutation Testing:** Deliberately introduces small changes (mutations) to the code and checks if the test cases can detect them.
    
    **Advantages of White Box Testing:**
    
    - **Targeted Approach:** Focuses on specific areas of code with potential issues.
    - **In-depth Testing:** Allows for a deeper understanding of how the application works.
    - **Early Bug Detection:** Catches errors early in the development lifecycle.
    
    **Disadvantages of White Box Testing:**
    
    - **Time-consuming:** Requires significant effort to understand the code and design test cases.
    - **Maintenance Challenges:** Tests might need to be updated frequently as the code changes.
    - **Skill Requirement:** Testers need strong programming skills.
    
    **Who should perform White Box Testing?**
    
    - Developers themselves can perform white box testing during the development process.
    - Software testers with strong programming knowledge can also be involved.
    
    ### cyclomatic complexity number:
    
    Cyclomatic complexity (CC) is a software metric used to indicate the complexity of a program's control flow. It's a quantitative measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. Higher CC indicates more complex code, which can be harder to understand, maintain, and test.
    
    There's no single "cyclomatic complexity number" because it depends on the specific code you're analyzing. However, there are formulas you can use to calculate CC for a given piece of code.
    
    Here's a common formula used to calculate cyclomatic complexity (McCabe's cyclomatic complexity):
    
    **CC = E - N + 2P**
    
    Where:
    
    - **E** is the number of edges (transfers of control) in the program's control flow graph.
    - **N** is the number of nodes (sequential groups of statements containing only one transfer of control) in the graph.
    - **P** is the number of connected components (separate subgraphs) in the graph.
    
    **Calculating CC helps developers:**
    
    - **Identify potentially error-prone code:** More complex code is more likely to contain errors due to the increased number of execution paths.
    - **Estimate testing effort:** Higher CC might suggest more test cases are needed to achieve thorough coverage.
    - **Improve code maintainability:** Understanding complexity can help developers write more modular and easier-to-understand code.
    
    ### Project:
    
    a project is a unique, temp. endeavor which defined start and end dates to achieve one or more objective within the constraint of cost, schedule and quality performance
    
    char of project:
    
    - non routine task
    - proper planning
    - clearly defined objective
    - several specification
    - have pre-determent time span
- product driven
    - output is product
- objective driven
    - output can be a objective

### project planning:

![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190501143924/Untitled-Diagram-110.jpg](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190501143924/Untitled-Diagram-110.jpg)

Project planning is a crucial step in any software engineering endeavor. It sets the roadmap for development, ensuring clarity, efficiency, and a higher chance of success. Here's a breakdown of key aspects involved in software project planning:

**1. Defining Scope and Requirements:**

- Clearly define the project's goals and functionalities. What problem are you solving? What features will the software have?
- Gather and document requirements from stakeholders (clients, users, etc.). This ensures everyone is on the same page about what needs to be built.

**2. Estimating Effort and Resources:**

- Based on the defined scope, estimate the time and resources (humanpower, hardware, software) needed for development.
- Techniques like work breakdown structure (WBS) can be used to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
- This helps in creating a realistic timeline and budget for the project.

**3. Choosing a Development Methodology:**

- Select a development methodology (e.g., Agile, Waterfall) that aligns with your project needs and team structure.
- Agile methodologies prioritize flexibility and continuous delivery, while Waterfall focuses on a more linear, pre-defined development process.

**4. Creating a Project Schedule:**

- Develop a timeline that outlines key milestones, deadlines, and task dependencies. Popular tools like Gantt charts can be used for visualization.
- The schedule should be realistic but ambitious, ensuring the project stays on track.

**5. Risk Management:**

- Identify potential risks that could impact the project (e.g., technical challenges, resource availability).
- Develop mitigation strategies for these risks to minimize their impact on the project.

**6. Communication and Collaboration:**

- Establish clear communication channels between developers, stakeholders, and other teams involved.
- Regular meetings (stand-ups, sprint reviews) keep everyone informed and facilitate collaboration.

**7. Version Control and Documentation:**

- Implement a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to the codebase and allow for rollbacks if necessary.
- Maintain clear and concise documentation to improve code readability and maintainability.

**8. Monitoring and Tracking Progress:**

- Regularly monitor project progress against the plan. Track metrics like completion rate, deadlines met, and resource utilization.
- Be prepared to adapt the plan based on new information or unforeseen circumstances.

**Benefits of Effective Project Planning:**

- Increased team productivity and focus
- Improved communication and collaboration
- Reduced development risks
- Enhanced project control and visibility
- Higher chance of meeting deadlines and budget constraints

### s/w size estimation:

- LOC(line of code)/ KLOC(kilo line of codes)
    - a line of code is any line of program text that is not a common or blank line this specifically includes all lines containing program header and declaration and executable and non executable statements
- function point analysis(Alan Albrecht)
    - 
    
    ![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230713163400/Functional-point-Analysis-(1)-768.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230713163400/Functional-point-Analysis-(1)-768.png)
    
    Function Point Analysis (FPA) is a technique used in software engineering to estimate the size and complexity of a software application based on its functionality. It provides a standardized way to measure the effort required for development and serves as a benchmark for comparing different projects.
    
    Here's a breakdown of key aspects of FPA:
    
    **What it Measures:**
    
    FPA focuses on the functionality delivered to the user, rather than the technical aspects of the implementation. It considers five main types of functionalities:
    
    - **External Inputs (EI):** User actions that provide data to the system (e.g., login form, search query).
    - **External Outputs (EO):** System responses that deliver information to the user (e.g., reports, error messages).
    - **Logical Internal Files (LIF):** Data structures maintained within the system (e.g., customer database, product catalog).
    - **Internal Logical Files (ILF):** Data processed or transformed within the system (e.g., temporary calculations, intermediate results).
    - **External Inquiries (EQ):** Simple data retrieval requests from the system (e.g., checking account balance).
    
    **How it Works:**
    
    1. **Identify Function Points:** The functionality of the software is analyzed, and each function is categorized into one of the five types mentioned above.
    2. **Assign Complexity Values:** A complexity rating (simple, average, complex) is assigned to each function based on predefined criteria.
    3. **Calculate Unadjusted Function Points (UFP):** A formula is used to calculate an UFP value for each function type, considering its complexity.
    4. **Apply Complexity Adjustment Factor (CAF):** A factor is calculated based on certain technical characteristics of the software, which is then applied to the UFP to get the final Function Point (FP) value.
    
    **Benefits of FPA:**
    
    - **Standardized Measurement:** Provides a common unit for comparing the size and complexity of different software projects.
    - **Effort Estimation:** Helps estimate the time and resources required for development based on the FP value.
    - **Project Comparison:** Facilitates comparison of functionalities between different versions of the same software or similar projects.
    - **Improved Communication:** Provides a basis for clear communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders about project scope and complexity.
    
    **Limitations of FPA:**
    
    - **Subjectivity:** Assigning complexity ratings can be subjective and require experience.
    - **Focus on Functionality:** Doesn't consider technical complexity like programming languages or chosen frameworks.
    - **Limited Scope:** May not be suitable for all types of software, particularly those heavily reliant on complex algorithms or user interface design.
        
        
        | **Measurement Parameter** | **Count** |  | **Weighing Factor** |  |  |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        |  |  | Total_Count | **Simple** | **Average** | **Complex** |
        | Number of external inputs (EI) | 32 | 32*4=128 | 3 | 4 | 6 |
        | Number of external outputs (EO) | 60 | 60*5=300 | 4 | 5 | 7 |
        | Number of external inquiries (EQ) | 24 | 24*4=96 | 3 | 4 | 6 |
        | Number of internal files (ILF) | 8 | 8*10=80 | 7 | 10 | 15 |
        | Number of external interfaces (EIF) | 2 | 2*7=14 | 5 | 7 | 10 |
        | Algorithms used Count total → |  | 618 |  |  |  |
        
        From the above tables, Functional Point is calculated with the following formula
        
        > FP = Count-Total * [0.65 + 0.01 * ⅀(fi)]= Count * CAF
        > 
        
        Here, the **count-total** is taken from the chart.
        
        > CAF = [0.65 + 0.01 * ⅀(fi)]
        > 
        1. ⅀**(fi) =** sum of all 14 questions and it also shows the complexity factor – CAF.
        2. CAF varies from 0.65 to 1.35 and ⅀**(fi)** ranges from 0 to 70.
        3. When ⅀**(fi)** = 0, CAF = 0.65 and when ⅀**(fi)** = 70, CAF = 0.65 + (0.01*70) = 0.65 + 0.7 = 1.35
        
        ### questions to be rated and find the complexity adjustment factor :
