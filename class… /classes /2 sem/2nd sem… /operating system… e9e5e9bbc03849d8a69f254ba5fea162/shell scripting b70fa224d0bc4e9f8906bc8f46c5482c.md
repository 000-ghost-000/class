# shell scripting

Here's a short note on what a shell is and various types of shells in operating systems:

**What is a Shell?**

- A shell is a program that acts as the user interface for an operating system, particularly in Unix-like systems. It provides a way for users to interact with the kernel by:
    - Accepting commands from the user through the keyboard.
    - Interpreting those commands.
    - Executing the commands by calling the appropriate system programs.
    - Displaying the output of the commands.
- Shells are essentially command-line interpreters, but they also offer features like:
    - Command history recall
    - Scripting capabilities
    - Variable manipulation
    - File manipulation

**Types of Shells:**

Operating systems offer different types of shells, each with its own syntax, features, and functionalities. Here are some common ones:

    ### operation in vi editor :
    
    Vi operates in three main modes:
    
    **1. Command Mode:**
    
    - This is the default mode when you open vi.
    - Any keystrokes entered in this mode are interpreted as commands, not text.
    - Commands allow you to move the cursor, edit text, save and quit, etc.
    - Examples of commands include:
        - `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`: Move cursor
        - `d`: Delete text
        - `y`: Copy text
        - `w`: Move to next word
        - `:wq`: Save and quit
    
    **2. Insert Mode:**
    
    - This mode allows you to insert text into the file.
    - You enter this mode by pressing `i`, `a`, `o`, or other specific keys.
    - Characters typed in this mode are directly inserted into the file.
    - Press `Esc` key to return to command mode.
    
    **3. Ex (Escape) Mode:**
    
    - This mode allows you to execute ex commands for advanced file manipulation.
    - You enter this mode by pressing `:` in command mode.
    - Examples of ex commands include:
        - `:w`: Save
        - `:q`: Quit
        - `:r`: Read a file
        - `:%s/old/new/g`: Replace all occurrences of "old" with "new"
    
    **Here are some additional points to remember:**
    
    - Vi does not explicitly indicate the current mode. You need to be aware of the context to understand which mode you're in.
    - Different keystrokes have different functions depending on the mode.
    - Mastering these modes and their associated commands is crucial for efficient use of vi.
    
    ### shell script :
    
    Here's a short note on shell scripts:
    
    **What is a Shell Script?**
    
    - A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell, a command-line interpreter.
    - It's a text file containing a series of commands that the shell executes one by one.
    - Shell scripts are similar to batch files in MS-DOS.
    - They typically use the `.sh` file extension.
    
    **Key Features:**
    
    - **Automating Tasks:** Shell scripts allow you to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
    - **Customizing Operations:** You can combine existing commands and create custom workflows to achieve specific goals.
    - **Error Handling:** Scripts can handle errors and provide feedback, making them more robust than manually executing commands.
    - **Portability:** Shell scripts are often portable across different Unix-like systems with similar shells.
    
    **Common Uses:**
    
    - Automating file management tasks (copying, moving, deleting)
    - System administration tasks (user management, configuration changes)
    - Data processing and analysis
    - Software installation and configuration
    - Creating custom commands
    
    **Benefits of Shell Scripting:**
    
    - **Efficiency:** Automates repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
    - **Accuracy:** Reduces human error by eliminating the need for manual command execution.
    - **Flexibility:** Can be customized for specific needs and workflows.
    - **Portability:** Scripts often work across different Unix-like systems.
    
    **Learning Shell Scripting:**
    
    - Shell scripting is a valuable skill for system administrators, developers, and anyone who wants to automate tasks in Unix-like environments.
    - Several resources are available online and in books to learn shell scripting basics and advanced concepts.
    
    **Popular Shell Scripting Languages:**
    
    - Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is the most common and widely used shell.
    - Other popular options include Z shell (zsh) and KornShell (ksh).
    
    ### shell scripting :
    
    **Steps:**
    
    1. **Create a Script File:**
        - Open a terminal window.
        - Navigate to the desired directory using the `cd` command.
        - Create a new file with a `.sh` extension using a text editor like `nano`:
            
            `nano hello_world.sh`
            
    2. **Write the Script:**
        - Inside the file, add the following lines:
            
            `#!/bin/bash
            echo "Hello World!"`
            
            - The first line, `#!/bin/bash`, is called the shebang line. It specifies the interpreter to be used for the script (bash in this case).
            - The second line uses the `echo` command to print the message "Hello World!"
    3. **Make the Script Executable:**
        - Save the file and exit the editor.
        - Use the `chmod +x` command to make the script executable:
            
            `chmod +x hello_world.sh`
            
    4. **Execute the Script:**
        - Run the script using its filename and the `./` prefix:
            
            `./hello_world.sh`
            
    
    **Output:**
    
    You should see the following output in your terminal:
    
    `Hello World!`
    
    **Explanation:**
    
    This is a simple example, but it demonstrates the basic steps of writing and executing a shell script. You can add more complex commands and logic to your scripts to automate tasks.
    
    **Additional Notes:**
    
    - You can use any text editor to create and edit shell scripts.
    - Comments (lines starting with `#`) are ignored by the shell and are used to explain the code.
    - Shell scripts can accept arguments from the command line using `$1`, `$2`, etc.
    - You can learn more about shell scripting commands, variables, control flow, and other features through online resources and tutorials.
    
    ### variable & system call :
    
    Here's a short note on shell variables and system calls:
    
    **Shell Variables:**
    
    - **Definition:** Named containers that store data (text, numbers) within a shell script.
    - **Types:**
        - **Local Variables:** Defined within functions or specific code blocks, accessible only within that scope.
        - **Global Variables:** Defined outside functions, accessible throughout the script.
        - **Environment Variables:** Defined outside the script, accessible by the script and potentially inherited by child processes.
    - **Assignment:** Values are assigned using the equal sign (`=`), without spaces around it.
    - **Accessing:** Referenced using the dollar sign (`$`) followed by the variable name.
    - **Benefits:**
        - Store data for later use within the script.
        - Make scripts more dynamic and reusable.
    
    **Example:**
    
    `#!/bin/bash
    NAME="John Doe"
    AGE=30
    
    echo "Hello, my name is $NAME and I am $AGE years old."`
    
    **System Calls:**
    
    - **Definition:** Requests made by a program (like a shell script) to the operating system kernel to perform specific tasks.
    - **Function:** Provide access to hardware resources and system services like file I/O, process management, network communication, etc.
    - **Mechanism:** Shell scripts interact with system calls through functions provided by the shell (e.g., `read`, `write`, `open`, `close`).
    - **Importance:** Allow scripts to interact with the underlying system and perform various operations.
    
    **Example:**
    
    `#!/bin/bash
    FILE_NAME="data.txt"
    
    # Open the file for reading
    read_file=$(cat $FILE_NAME)
    
    # Print the contents of the file
    echo "$read_file"`
    
    This script uses the `cat` system call (accessed through the `cat` command) to read the contents of a file and stores them in a variable.
    
    **Key Points:**
    
    - Shell variables store data within the script, while system calls interact with the operating system kernel.
    - Variables hold data that the script manipulates, while system calls request services from the kernel.
    - Understanding both is crucial for writing effective and powerful shell scripts.
    
    ### piper & filter :
    
    Here's a short note on pipes and filters in operating systems:
    
    **Pipes:**
    
    - Pipes are a mechanism in operating systems, particularly Unix-like systems, that allow the output of one command to be directly fed as the input of another command.
    - This is represented by the vertical bar (|) symbol on the command line.
    - When commands are connected with pipes, the data flows from left to right:
        - The command on the left of the pipe writes its output to the standard output (stdout).
        - The command on the right of the pipe reads its input from the standard input (stdin).
    
    **Filters:**
    
    - Filters are programs designed to process data streams. They typically take input from stdin, perform some operation on that data, and write the modified output to stdout.
    - Many common Unix commands can be used as filters, such as:
        - `grep`: Searches for specific patterns in text.
        - `sort`: Sorts lines of text.
        - `cut`: Extracts specific columns from text.
        - `head`: Displays the first few lines of a file.
        - `tail`: Displays the last few lines of a file.
    
    **Combining Pipes and Filters:**
    
    By chaining commands with pipes, you can create powerful data processing pipelines. Each command acts as a filter, transforming the data before passing it to the next filter in the chain.
    
    **Example:**
    
    `cat file.txt | grep "error" | sort`
    
    This example:
    
    1. Uses `cat` to read the contents of `file.txt`.
    2. Pipes the output to `grep`, which searches for lines containing the word "error".
    3. Pipes the filtered output to `sort`, which sorts the lines alphabetically.
    
    The final result displays lines containing "error" from the file, sorted alphabetically.
    
    **Benefits of Pipes and Filters:**
    
    - **Modular Design:** Each command can be considered an independent module, making pipelines easy to build and maintain.
    - **Data Processing Efficiency:** Complex data transformations can be achieved by chaining simple commands.
    - **Flexibility:** Different filters can be combined in various ways to achieve diverse results.
    
    ### if else , switch decision making :
    
    Shell scripting offers various ways to make decisions based on conditions, allowing you to control the flow of your script. Here are the main types:
    
    **1. if-fi Statement:**
    
    - This is the simplest form of decision making. It checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.
    - Syntax:
    
    `if [ condition ]; then
      # code to execute if condition is true
    fi`
    
    - Example:
    
    `#!/bin/bash
    
    NUMBER=10
    
    if [ $NUMBER -gt 5 ]; then
      echo "The number is greater than 5."
    fi`
    
    **2. if-else-fi Statement:**
    
    - This extends the if statement by adding an else block that executes if the initial condition is false.
    - Syntax:
    
    `if [ condition ]; then
      # code to execute if condition is true
    else
      # code to execute if condition is false
    fi`
    
    - Example:
    
    `#!/bin/bash
    
    AGE=25
    
    if [ $AGE -ge 18 ]; then
      echo "You are eligible to vote."
    else
      echo "You are not eligible to vote."
    fi`
    
    **3. if-elif-else-fi Statement:**
    
    - This allows checking multiple conditions sequentially. It uses elif (else if) to chain additional conditions.
    - Syntax:
    
    `if [ condition1 ]; then
      # code to execute if condition1 is true
    elif [ condition2 ]; then
      # code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
    else
      # code to execute if all conditions are false
    fi`
    
    - Example:
    
    `#!/bin/bash
    
    GRADE="A"
    
    if [ $GRADE -eq "A" ]; then
      echo "Excellent work!"
    elif [ $GRADE -eq "B" ]; then
      echo "Good job!"
    else
      echo "Keep working hard!"
    fi`
    
    **4. case-esac Statement:**
    
    - Similar to a switch statement in other languages, it checks a variable against multiple patterns and executes the corresponding code block.
    - Syntax:
    
    `case $variable in
      pattern1)
        # code to execute if variable matches pattern1
        ;;
      pattern2)
        # code to execute if variable matches pattern2
        ;;
      *)
        # code to execute if none of the patterns match (default)
        ;;
    esac`
    
    - Example:
    
    `#!/bin/bash
    
    DAY_OF_WEEK=$(date +%u)
    
    case $DAY_OF_WEEK in
      1)
        echo "It's Monday."
        ;;
      2)
        echo "It's Tuesday."
        ;;
      *)
        echo "It's another day of the week."
        ;;
    esac`
    Remember to use double square brackets `[[ ]]` around conditions for better string comparisons and operator precedence. These decision-making structures allow you to create complex logic and control the flow of your shell scripts effectively.
    
    ### loops:
    
    Shell scripting offers different types of loops to repeat tasks a specific number of times or until a certain condition is met. Here's a breakdown:
    
    **1. for Loop:**
    
    - Iterates over a list of items or a range of numbers, executing a block of code for each item.
    - Syntax:
    
    `for variable in list_of_items; do
      # code to execute for each item
    done`
    
    - Example:
    
    `#!/bin/bash
    
    NAMES=("Alice" "Bob" "Charlie")
    
    for NAME in "${NAMES[@]}"; do
      echo "Hello, $NAME!"
    done`
    
    This script iterates through the array `NAMES` and prints a greeting message for each name.
    
    **2. while Loop:**
    
    - Executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true.
    - Syntax:
    
    `while condition; do
      # code to execute while condition is true
    done`
    
    - Example:
    
    `#!/bin/bash
    
    COUNT=1
    
    while [ $COUNT -le 5 ]; do
      echo "Iteration number: $COUNT"
      COUNT=$((COUNT + 1))
    done`
    
    This script iterates 5 times, printing the current iteration number each time.
    
    **3. until Loop:**
    
    - Similar to while loop, but continues executing the code block until the specified condition becomes true.
    - Syntax:
    
    `until condition; do
      # code to execute until condition is true
    done`
    
    - Example:
    
    `#!/bin/bash
    
    PASSWORD=""
    
    until [ "$PASSWORD" = "secret" ]; do
      read -s -p "Enter password: " PASSWORD
    done
    
    echo "Correct password entered!"`
    
    This script prompts the user for a password repeatedly until the correct password ("secret") is entered.
    
    **Additional Notes:**
    
    - Loops can be nested, meaning you can place one loop inside another for more complex control flow.
    - You can use `break` to exit a loop prematurely and `continue` to skip to the next iteration.
    - Choosing the right loop type depends on your specific needs and the logic you want to achieve.
    
    These basic loops provide a foundation for controlling the flow of your shell scripts and automating repetitive tasks efficiently.
    
    ### functions :
    
    Functions in shell scripting are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They offer several benefits:
    
    - **Modularity:** Break down complex scripts into smaller, manageable units.
    - **Code Reusability:** Use the same function in different parts of the script or even other scripts.
    - **Improved Readability:** Make scripts easier to understand and maintain.
    
    **Defining Functions:**
    
    `function_name() {
      # code to be executed by the function
    }`
    
    - `function_name`: A valid name for your function.
    - The code block within the curly braces (`{}`) defines the actions the function performs.
    
    **Example:**
    
    `#!/bin/bash
    
    function greet() {
      NAME="$1"  # Access the first argument passed to the function
      echo "Hello, $NAME!"
    }
    
    greet "John Doe"  # Call the function with an argument`
    
    **Accessing Arguments:**
    
    - Positional arguments are accessed using `$n`, where `n` represents the position (1st, 2nd, etc.).
    - You can pass any number of arguments to a function.
    
    **Returning Values:**
    
    - Use the `return` keyword to send a value back from the function.
    - This value can be used by the code that called the function.
    
    **Example:**
    
    `#!/bin/bash
    
    function add() {
      NUM1=$1
      NUM2=$2
      SUM=$((NUM1 + NUM2))
      return $SUM  # Return the calculated sum
    }
    
    result=$(add 5 10)  # Call the function and store the returned value
    echo "The sum is: $result"`
    
    **Benefits of Functions:**
    
    - Promote code organization and maintainability.
    - Enhance script efficiency by avoiding code duplication.
    - Increase script readability by separating functionalities.
    
    Remember, functions are a powerful tool for structuring and organizing your shell scripts effectively.
    
    ### utility program :
    
    Utility programs are essential tools built into operating systems or available as standalone applications. They perform various tasks related to system maintenance, optimization, and management. Here are some common examples with code snippets:
    
    **1. File Management:**
    
    - **cp:** Copies files from one location to another.

    `sort users.txt  # Sorts lines in users.txt alphabetically`
    
    **3. Disk Management:**
    
    - **df:** Displays information about disk usage.
    
    `df /  # Shows disk usage for root partition`
    
    - **du:** Estimates disk usage of files and directories.
    
    `du -h documents  # Shows disk usage of the "documents" directory in human-readable format`
    
    - **free:** Displays available and used memory.
    
    `free  # Shows free and used memory information`
    
    **4. Network Utilities:**
    
    - **ping:** Checks network connectivity by sending ping requests.
    
    `ping google.com  # Pings google.com to check if it's reachable`
    
    - **netstat:** Displays network connections and statistics.
    
    `netstat -a  # Shows active network connections`
    
    **5. Compression and Archiving:**
    
    - **tar:** Creates and extracts archive files (e.g., .tar, .gz).
    
    `tar -cvf archive.tar documents  # Creates a tar archive of the "documents" directory
    tar -xf archive.tar  # Extracts the contents of archive.tar`
    
    - **zip:** Creates and extracts zip archive files.
    
    `zip -r archive.zip documents  # Creates a zip archive of the "documents" directory
    unzip archive.zip  # Extracts the contents of archive.zip`
    
    These are just a few examples, and different operating systems might have additional utilities with specific functionalities. Remember, these tools play a crucial role in managing and maintaining your computer system efficiently.
    
    ### pattern utility :
    
    **1. grep:**
    
    - grep is the most common tool for searching plain text files for specific patterns.
    - It utilizes regular expressions to define complex search criteria.
    
    **Example:**
    
    `grep "error" system.log  # Searches for lines containing "error" in system.log
    grep -i "warning" log_file  # Case-insensitive search for "warning" in log_file
    grep -n "root" users.txt  # Shows line numbers where "root" appears in users.txt`
    
    **2. sed:**
    
    - sed (stream editor) allows searching and replacing text within files based on patterns.
    
    **Example:**
    
    `sed 's/error/success/g' file.txt  # Replaces all occurrences of "error" with "success" in file.txt
    sed '/^$/d' file.txt  # Deletes empty lines in file.txt
    sed 's/[0-9]//g' phone_numbers.txt  # Removes all digits from phone_numbers.txt`
    
    **3. awk:**
    
    - awk is a powerful data processing and analysis tool that excels at pattern matching and manipulation within text files.
    
    **Example:**
    
    `awk '/root/{print $1}' users.txt  # Prints the first column (username) for lines containing "root"
    awk '$2 > 10 {print $0}' data.csv  # Prints lines where the second field is greater than 10 in data.csv
    awk '{count++; print count}' access_log  # Counts and prints the number of lines in access_log`
    
    These are just a few examples, and each tool offers various options and features for advanced pattern matching tasks. Remember, understanding regular expressions is crucial for effectively utilizing these tools for complex searches and text manipulation.
