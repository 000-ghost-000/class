## distributed system :

A distributed system is a network of autonomous computers connected
using a distribution middleware. They help share different resources and
capabilities to provide users with a single integrated, coherent
network. like banking system

### importance :

- transparency
- local processing global processing

## real time operating system :

A real-time operating system (RTOS) is a type of operating system
that is designed to process data as it comes in, typically within a very
short timeframe. These systems are used in environments where a high
degree of reliability is required and where events must be processed in
a deterministic manner. Examples of real-time systems include air
traffic control systems, network systems, and certain complex industrial
systems.

### types :

- soft
- hard

## multiprocessor system :

A Multiprocessor system is a computer system with two or more central
processing units (CPUs), also known as processors, that share a common
bus, memory, and peripherals. These systems are mainly used to increase
the system’s processing power, allowing it to perform more tasks
simultaneously and improving overall system performance. They are widely
used in complex scientific and business applications.

### multi threaded :

- Involves the ability of an operating system to manage and execute multiple threads within a single process.
- A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process, with its own program counter and stack but sharing the same memory and resources as other threads in the process.

**Benefits:**

- **Improved performance:** Multithreading allows programs to break down tasks into smaller, concurrent threads, potentially utilizing multiple CPU cores for parallel execution and reducing overall execution time.
- **Enhanced responsiveness:** By handling multiple threads within a process, multithreading can improve the responsiveness of applications, especially those involving user interaction.
- **Better resource utilization:** Multithreading can lead to better utilization of resources like CPU and memory by keeping the CPU busy even when one thread is waiting for I/O operations.
- **Modular code organization:** Dividing complex tasks into smaller threads can improve code organization and maintainability.

**Key Points:**

- Threads share memory and resources within a process but have their own program counter and stack.
- Multithreading is distinct from multiprocessing, which involves running multiple processes simultaneously on multiple CPU cores.
- Operating systems handle thread creation, scheduling, and synchronization to ensure efficient execution and avoid conflicts between threads.

**Examples of Multithreaded Applications:**

- Web servers handling multiple client requests concurrently.
- Media players handling audio/video decoding and playback simultaneously.
- Word processors allowing multiple users to edit different parts of a document simultaneously.
