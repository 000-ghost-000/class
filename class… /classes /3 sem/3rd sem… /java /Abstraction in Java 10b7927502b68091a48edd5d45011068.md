# Abstraction in Java

### **1. Theoretical Overview of Abstraction**

---

**Abstraction** is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), along with Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. It refers to the process of **hiding the complex implementation details** of a system and exposing only the necessary features or functionalities to the user.

### **Key Concepts of Abstraction:**

- **Purpose**: Abstraction allows us to focus on **what** an object does, rather than **how** it does it. It hides unnecessary details and exposes only relevant information, making it easier to work with complex systems.
- **Abstraction vs. Encapsulation**:
    - **Abstraction** is about hiding the implementation details and showing only essential information to the user.
    - **Encapsulation** is about hiding the internal data and protecting it from unauthorized access.
- **Types of Abstraction in Java**:
    1. **Abstract Classes**: These are classes that cannot be instantiated directly but can be used as a blueprint for other classes.
    2. **Interfaces**: These are fully abstract types that can declare methods but do not provide any method body.

### **Why Abstraction is Important:**

- **Simplicity**: Abstraction simplifies complex systems by providing a high-level view and hiding details.
- **Reusability**: By defining abstract methods, developers can ensure code reusability as multiple classes can share common functionalities.
- **Maintainability**: Systems designed using abstraction are easier to maintain and extend as their core functionality is separated from implementation details.

### **2. Abstraction in Java: Practical Implementation**

### **Abstract Classes**

An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and can have both abstract and non-abstract methods. **Abstract methods** are methods that are declared without an implementation (i.e., they do not have a body), and it is the responsibility of the subclasses to provide concrete implementations of these methods.

### **Syntax for Abstract Class**:

```java
abstract class ClassName {
    // Abstract method (no body)
    abstract void abstractMethod();

    // Non-abstract method (with body)
    void nonAbstractMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a concrete method.");
    }
}

```

### **Example of Abstract Class**:

```java
abstract class Shape {

    // Abstract method
    abstract double area();

    // Concrete method
    void displayShape() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    double radius;

    // Constructor
    Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    // Implementing abstract method
    @Override
    double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    double width, height;

    // Constructor
    Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    // Implementing abstract method
    @Override
    double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Shape s = new Shape(); // Error: Cannot instantiate abstract class
        Shape circle = new Circle(5.0);
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(4.0, 6.0);

        // Display shape details
        circle.displayShape();
        System.out.println("Circle Area: " + circle.area());

        rectangle.displayShape();
        System.out.println("Rectangle Area: " + rectangle.area());
    }
}

```

### **Output**:

```
This is a shape.
Circle Area: 78.53981633974483
This is a shape.
Rectangle Area: 24.0

```

### **Key Points of Abstract Class**:

1. An abstract class **cannot be instantiated**.
2. It can have **both abstract and concrete methods**.
3. Subclasses are required to provide implementations for **abstract methods**.
4. It can have constructors and static methods.
5. Abstract classes are used when we need to provide a **base class** with some shared functionality (concrete methods) but also expect that **subclasses will define their specific behaviors** (abstract methods).

---

### **Interfaces**

An **interface** is a reference type in Java that is **fully abstract**, meaning it can only contain abstract methods (though default and static methods are allowed from Java 8 onwards). Interfaces are used to achieve **100% abstraction** and can be implemented by multiple classes.

### **Syntax for Interface**:

```java
interface InterfaceName {
    // Abstract method
    void method1();

    // Default method (from Java 8)
    default void method2() {
        System.out.println("This is a default method.");
    }
}

```

### **Example of Interface**:

```java
interface Vehicle {
    // Abstract method
    void start();

    void stop();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {

    // Implementing interface methods
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts with a key.");
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Car stops with brakes.");
    }
}

class Bicycle implements Vehicle {

    // Implementing interface methods
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Bicycle starts by pedaling.");
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Bicycle stops by applying brakes.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = new Car();
        car.start();
        car.stop();

        Vehicle bike = new Bicycle();
        bike.start();
        bike.stop();
    }
}

```

### **Output**:

```
Car starts with a key.
Car stops with brakes.
Bicycle starts by pedaling.
Bicycle stops by applying brakes.

```

### **Key Points of Interfaces**:

1. **All methods** in an interface are **abstract by default** (until Java 8, which introduced default and static methods).
2. A class **implements** an interface using the `implements` keyword.
3. A class can **implement multiple interfaces**, thereby achieving **multiple inheritance**.
4. Interfaces are used to define a **contract** that implementing classes must follow.
5. Interfaces cannot have constructors or instance fields (variables must be `static final` by default).

### **Differences Between Abstract Classes and Interfaces**

| Feature | Abstract Class | Interface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Nature** | Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods. | Contains only abstract methods (default and static methods from Java 8). |
| **Instantiation** | Cannot be instantiated. | Cannot be instantiated. |
| **Constructors** | Can have constructors. | Cannot have constructors. |
| **Method Implementation** | Subclasses provide implementations for abstract methods. | Classes that implement the interface must provide implementations for all methods. |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | Does not support multiple inheritance. | Supports multiple inheritance. |
| **Fields** | Can have instance variables. | Can have only `static final` variables. |
| **Use Case** | Used when classes share some behavior, and some parts are left for the subclass to define. | Used to define a contract for behavior across different classes. |

---

### **When to Use Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces**:

1. **Use Abstract Classes** when:
    - You want to share code among several closely related classes.
    - You want to define **both** abstract and non-abstract methods.
    - You need to define **state** (fields or properties) shared among subclasses.
2. **Use Interfaces** when:
    - You need to define a **common behavior** that can be applied to unrelated classes.
    - You need to achieve **multiple inheritance**.
    - You want to **decouple** the implementation from the class hierarchy.

---

### **Practical Example Combining Both**:

You can use **both abstract classes** and **interfaces** in combination to create a more flexible and powerful design.

```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();
}

class Bird extends Animal implements Flyable {

    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bird chirps.");
    }

    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Bird flies in the sky.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bird sparrow = new Bird();
        sparrow.sound();
        sparrow.fly();
    }
}

```

### **Output**:

```
Bird chirps.
Bird flies in the sky.

```

In this example:

- **`Animal`** is an abstract class that defines an abstract method `sound()`.
- **`Flyable`** is an interface that requires the `fly()` method to be implemented.
- **`Bird`** extends the abstract class `Animal` and implements the interface `Flyable`, providing implementations for both the `sound()` and `fly()` methods.

This approach offers a highly flexible system with clear separation of concerns.

```java
// Abstract class Shape
abstract class Shape {
    // Abstract method
    abstract void draw();
}

// Rectangle class that extends Shape
class Rectangle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }
}

// Circle class that extends Shape
class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

// Main class for execution
public class abc {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create objects of Rectangle and Circle
        Shape rect = new Rectangle();
        Shape circ = new Circle();

        // Call draw method for each object
        rect.draw();
        circ.draw();
    }
}
```

```java
class Library{
void add();
void modify();
}
```
