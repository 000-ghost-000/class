# Run&Compile

To compile and run your `Main.java` file from the terminal in macOS, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open Terminal

Open the Terminal application on your Mac.

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory

Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your `Main.java` file is located. For example:

```bash
cd /Users/abhishek/Documents/your_project_directory

```

### Step 3: Compile the Java Files

You need to compile all the Java files (including `Main.java`, `DatabaseConnection.java`, `Product.java`, `Customer.java`, `Order.java`, `OrderItem.java`, `ProductDAO.java`, `CustomerDAO.java`, `OrderDAO.java`) at once. You can use a wildcard to compile all `.java` files:

```bash
javac *.java -cp /Users/abhishek/Documents/mysql-connector-j-9.0.0/mysql-connector-j-9.0.0.jar

```

### Step 4: Run the Main Class

After successful compilation, run the `Main` class with the following command:

```bash
java -cp .:/Users/abhishek/Documents/mysql-connector-j-9.0.0/mysql-connector-j-9.0.0.jar Main

```

### Summary of Commands

1. Navigate to the directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd /Users/abhishek/Documents/your_project_directory
    
    ```
    
2. Compile the Java files:
    
    ```bash
    javac *.java -cp /Users/abhishek/Documents/mysql-connector-j-9.0.0/mysql-connector-j-9.0.0.jar
    
    ```
    
3. Run the Main class:
    
    ```bash
    java -cp .:/Users/abhishek/Documents/mysql-connector-j-9.0.0/mysql-connector-j-9.0.0.jar Main
    
    ```
    

### Note

- Make sure your terminal is pointing to the correct directory containing your Java files.
- Ensure you have the MySQL Connector/J JAR file path correctly specified. Adjust if necessary.
