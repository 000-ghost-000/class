### Threads in Java: Detailed Notes

### 1. **Introduction to Threads in Java**

- **Thread** is a lightweight process that allows multiple operations to run concurrently within a program.
- In Java, threads are part of the **multithreading** feature, where a program can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
- A thread is essentially a unit of execution in a program.
- **Multithreading** is commonly used for improving the performance of a program, especially in the case of I/O operations or computational tasks that can be parallelized.

### 2. **Why Use Threads?**

- **Concurrency**: Allows a program to perform multiple tasks at the same time.
- **Resource Utilization**: Helps in utilizing the CPU efficiently, as CPU time can be divided between different threads.
- **Improved Performance**: Especially in I/O-bound or network-bound applications, threads can significantly improve the throughput by not blocking the entire application.
- **Responsiveness**: For GUI applications, threads can keep the UI responsive while performing background tasks.

### 3. **Lifecycle of a Thread**

A thread in Java goes through several states in its lifecycle:

- **New**: A thread is in this state when it has been created but not yet started.
- **Runnable**: Once the thread's `start()` method is called, it becomes runnable and eligible to be picked by the thread scheduler to run.
- **Blocked/Waiting**: A thread may enter this state when it waits for a resource, such as I/O, or when it explicitly waits (`wait()`, `sleep()`, etc.).
- **Running**: The thread is actively executing its task.
- **Terminated**: The thread completes its execution or is terminated by an exception.

### 4. **Creating Threads in Java**

There are two main ways to create a thread in Java:

**a. Extending the `Thread` class**:

- You can create a class that extends `Thread` and overrides the `run()` method.
- Example:
    
    ```java
    class MyThread extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Thread is running");
        }
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
            t1.start();  // Starts the thread, invoking the run() method
        }
    }
    
    ```
    

**b. Implementing the `Runnable` interface**:

- This is the preferred method, especially when you want to extend another class.
- Example:
    
    ```java
    class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Thread is running");
        }
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
            Thread t1 = new Thread(myRunnable);
            t1.start();  // Starts the thread, invoking the run() method
        }
    }
    
    ```
    

### 5. **Thread Methods**

Java provides several methods to control thread behavior:

- **`start()`**: Starts the execution of the thread by invoking the `run()` method in a new thread.
- **`run()`**: Contains the code that defines the task to be performed by the thread.
- **`sleep(long milliseconds)`**: Makes the thread pause for the specified time in milliseconds.
- **`join()`**: Allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread.
- **`yield()`**: Suggests to the thread scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of the CPU.
- **`wait()`**: Makes the thread wait until another thread calls `notify()` or `notifyAll()` on the same object.
- **`notify()` / `notifyAll()`**: Wakes up a single thread (`notify()`) or all threads (`notifyAll()`) waiting on the object's monitor.
- **`isAlive()`**: Returns `true` if the thread is still alive, i.e., it has been started but not yet terminated.

### 6. **Thread Priorities**

- Java threads can have different priorities, which are integers ranging from `1` (minimum) to `10` (maximum).
- The default priority is `5`, but it can be set using the `setPriority()` method.
- The JVM uses these priorities to determine which threads to schedule, though this is platform-dependent.

### 7. **Synchronization**

- **Race conditions** and **thread interference** can occur when multiple threads try to modify shared resources concurrently.
- Java provides a **synchronization** mechanism to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources.
- **Synchronized blocks** or methods can be used to ensure that only one thread accesses a critical section of code at a time.
- Example:
    
    ```java
    class Counter {
        private int count = 0;
    
        public synchronized void increment() {
            count++;
        }
    
        public int getCount() {
            return count;
        }
    }
    
    ```
    

### 8. **Thread Synchronization Methods**

- **Synchronized Method**: Only one thread can execute a synchronized method of an object at a time.
- **Synchronized Block**: Limits the scope of synchronization to a smaller code block rather than the entire method.
- **Static Synchronization**: If a method is `static`, synchronization applies to the class-level lock rather than the instance-level lock.
- **Lock and Conditions**: `ReentrantLock` and `Condition` in `java.util.concurrent.locks` package provide more sophisticated thread synchronization options.

### 9. **Thread Pooling**

- Creating a new thread for every task can be resource-intensive. Instead, you can use **thread pools** to manage a pool of worker threads.
- Java provides the `ExecutorService` interface in the `java.util.concurrent` package, which offers a way to manage thread pools.
- Example:
    
    ```java
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
    executor.submit(new MyRunnable());  // Submitting a task to the pool
    executor.shutdown();  // Shut down the pool after execution
    
    ```
    

### 10. **Deadlock**

- **Deadlock** occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release a resource.
- This can happen when synchronized code has nested locks.
- To avoid deadlocks:
    - Lock resources in the same order.
    - Use **tryLock()** methods provided in `ReentrantLock`.

### 11. **Thread Communication**

- Threads often need to communicate with each other during execution.
- Java provides the `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` methods to facilitate communication between threads, especially when one thread is producing data and another is consuming it (i.e., the producer-consumer problem).
- These methods must be called within a synchronized context.

### 12. **Daemon Threads**

- Daemon threads are background threads that provide services to user threads.
- A thread can be marked as a daemon thread using the `setDaemon(true)` method.
- Daemon threads are terminated by the JVM when all user threads complete their execution.
- Example use cases: garbage collection, background monitoring.

### 13. **Volatile Keyword**

- The `volatile` keyword is used for variables that are accessed by multiple threads.
- It ensures that the value of the variable is always read from the main memory and not cached, which helps avoid issues with visibility of shared data across threads.

### 14. **Concurrency Utilities**

- Javaâ€™s `java.util.concurrent` package provides a variety of classes and interfaces that simplify working with threads:
    - **`CountDownLatch`**: Allows one or more threads to wait for a set of operations to complete.
    - **`CyclicBarrier`**: Allows a set of threads to all wait for each other to reach a common barrier point.
    - **`Semaphore`**: Controls access to a resource through permits.
    - **`Concurrent Collections`**: Thread-safe collections like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `BlockingQueue`, etc.

### 15. **Best Practices with Threads**

- Always prefer implementing `Runnable` over extending `Thread` unless required.
- Avoid thread interference by using synchronization or concurrent utilities.
- Avoid deadlocks by being mindful of resource locks and their order.
- Use thread pools for better resource management.
- Handle thread termination properly by using `join()` and `shutdown()` methods.
- Use `volatile` for shared variables that may be accessed by multiple threads.
- Keep your thread's logic simple and modular to reduce complexity in debugging multithreaded code.

These points cover the essentials of working with threads in Java, ensuring efficient, safe, and concurrent execution of tasks.

### thread priority

### Thread Priority in Java: Detailed Notes

### 1. **Introduction to Thread Priority**

- **Thread priority** in Java is an integer value associated with each thread that hints to the thread scheduler about the relative importance of the thread.
- Thread priority determines the order in which threads are executed, especially when multiple threads are competing for CPU resources.
- The thread scheduler (which is platform-dependent) uses these priorities to decide which thread to run next, but it does not guarantee the execution order based solely on priority.

### 2. **Priority Range in Java**

- Java provides a range of priorities from **1** to **10**, where:
    - **1** is the **lowest** priority (`Thread.MIN_PRIORITY`).
    - **10** is the **highest** priority (`Thread.MAX_PRIORITY`).
    - **5** is the **default** priority (`Thread.NORM_PRIORITY`).
- These constants are provided in the `Thread` class:
    
    ```java
    public static final int MIN_PRIORITY = 1;
    public static final int NORM_PRIORITY = 5;
    public static final int MAX_PRIORITY = 10;
    
    ```
    

### 3. **Setting and Getting Thread Priority**

- **Setting thread priority**: You can set the priority of a thread using the `setPriority()` method.
- **Getting thread priority**: You can retrieve the current priority of a thread using the `getPriority()` method.

Example:

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running thread with priority: " + this.getPriority());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);  // Setting low priority

        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();
        t2.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);  // Setting high priority

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}

```

### 4. **How Thread Priority Works**

- Java threads are scheduled based on their priority, but the **scheduling policy is platform-dependent**.
- On most systems, the JVM uses a **preemptive, priority-based scheduling** mechanism.
    - A **preemptive scheduler** allows a higher-priority thread to preempt a lower-priority thread.
    - If two threads have the same priority, the scheduler uses a **time-slicing** approach where each thread gets a fair share of CPU time.
- **Note**: Although priority helps the thread scheduler make decisions, it is not a strict guarantee that higher-priority threads will always be executed before lower-priority threads. It depends on the underlying operating system and its thread-scheduling algorithm.

### 5. **Thread Priority Example**

- This example demonstrates how to set and retrieve thread priorities.

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName() +
                           " | Priority: " + Thread.currentThread().getPriority());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t3 = new MyThread();

        t1.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);  // Priority = 1
        t2.setPriority(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY); // Priority = 5
        t3.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);  // Priority = 10

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();
    }
}

```

**Expected Output**:

```
Thread: Thread-0 | Priority: 1
Thread: Thread-1 | Priority: 5
Thread: Thread-2 | Priority: 10

```

### 6. **Default Thread Priority**

- By default, every thread created in Java inherits the priority of the thread that created it.
- For example, the main thread (i.e., the thread that starts the program) has a default priority of `5`. Any thread created by the main thread will inherit this priority unless it is explicitly set.

Example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main thread priority: " + Thread.currentThread().getPriority());

        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();  // Inherits priority from the main thread (priority 5)
    }
}

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Child thread priority: " + this.getPriority());
    }
}

```

**Output**:

```
Main thread priority: 5
Child thread priority: 5

```

### 7. **Effects of Changing Thread Priority**

- The effect of changing thread priority is **platform-dependent**.
    - On some systems, higher-priority threads may always preempt lower-priority threads.
    - On other systems, priority might only have a subtle effect on execution, with lower-priority threads still getting significant CPU time.
- This means that setting thread priority can provide a *hint* to the operating system but should not be relied upon for strict task execution order.

### 8. **Best Practices for Using Thread Priority**

- **Use Default Priority**: In most cases, it is best to rely on the default thread priority (`NORM_PRIORITY = 5`) and avoid explicit priority setting.
- **Avoid Priority-based Logic**: Do not design your programâ€™s logic to depend on thread priority. Different systems may handle priorities differently, leading to unpredictable behavior.
- **Testing on Different Platforms**: If you must use thread priority, test your application on different platforms to ensure consistent behavior.
- **Use Thread Pools**: Instead of manually adjusting thread priority, consider using **thread pools** (like those provided by `ExecutorService`) that manage threads more effectively, balancing load automatically without relying on priorities.

### 9. **Thread Priority in Multithreaded Applications**

- In **multithreaded applications**, adjusting the priority can be useful in certain cases, such as:
    - **Background tasks**: Setting a lower priority for threads performing background tasks (like logging or data backup) to ensure they do not interfere with the main tasks.
    - **Time-sensitive tasks**: Assigning higher priority to time-critical threads, but this should be done sparingly as it can lead to **starvation** of lower-priority threads.

### 10. **Thread Starvation**

- **Thread starvation** happens when a lower-priority thread is perpetually prevented from running because higher-priority threads dominate the CPU.
- In extreme cases, a low-priority thread may never get CPU time if there is a constant stream of higher-priority threads.
- To avoid thread starvation:
    - Limit the use of high-priority threads.
    - Use techniques like **priority inversion avoidance**, where a lower-priority thread is temporarily boosted if it holds a resource needed by a higher-priority thread.

### 11. **Priority Inversion**

- **Priority inversion** occurs when a lower-priority thread holds a resource that a higher-priority thread needs, causing the higher-priority thread to be blocked.
- For example:
    - Thread A (low priority) holds a lock on a resource.
    - Thread B (high priority) wants to acquire the same resource, but it gets blocked because Thread A has the lock.
    - If a medium-priority thread (Thread C) runs without needing the resource, it may execute freely while Thread B is still blocked, leading to **priority inversion**.
- Java doesnâ€™t automatically solve priority inversion, but techniques like **priority inheritance** in real-time operating systems can be used to temporarily raise the priority of the low-priority thread holding the resource.

### 12. **Example: Demonstrating Thread Starvation**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public MyThread(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " executing with priority: " +
                               Thread.currentThread().getPriority());
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread("Thread-1");
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread("Thread-2");
        MyThread t3 = new MyThread("Thread-3");

        t1.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);  // Highest priority
        t2.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);  // Lowest priority
        t3.setPriority(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY); // Normal priority

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();
    }
}

```

**Output**:

```
Thread-1 executing with priority: 10
Thread-1 executing with priority: 10
...
Thread-3 executing with priority: 5
...
Thread-2 executing with priority: 1
...

```

- In this case, `Thread-1` may dominate CPU time since it has the highest priority. Depending on the system, `Thread-2` (with low priority) might execute less frequently, leading to **thread starvation**.

### 13. **Conclusion**

- Thread priority in Java allows you to influence the order in which threads are executed, but its actual effect depends on the JVM and underlying operating system.
- It is generally recommended to use the default priority for most tasks and

### thread synchronization

### Thread Synchronization in Java: Detailed Notes

### 1. **Introduction to Thread Synchronization**

- **Thread synchronization** in Java is a mechanism that ensures two or more concurrent threads do not simultaneously execute critical sections of a program, which can lead to unpredictable results, known as **race conditions**.
- Synchronization ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource or critical section of the code at a time.
- This is particularly important when multiple threads access or modify shared data, ensuring **data consistency** and **integrity**.

### 2. **What Is a Critical Section?**

- A **critical section** is a part of the code that accesses shared resources (like variables, data structures, files) and must be executed by only one thread at a time to avoid race conditions.
- Java uses synchronization to protect these critical sections.

### 3. **Synchronization in Java**

- Java provides two primary mechanisms for synchronizing code:
    1. **Synchronized methods**
    2. **Synchronized blocks**
- Additionally, synchronization is also used in **inter-thread communication** using methods like `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`.

### 4. **Synchronized Methods**

- A **synchronized method** ensures that only one thread can access the method at a time. When a thread enters a synchronized method, it **acquires a lock** on the object, preventing other threads from entering any other synchronized method on the same object.
- Example:
    
    ```java
    class Counter {
        private int count = 0;
    
        public synchronized void increment() {
            count++;
        }
    
        public int getCount() {
            return count;
        }
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            Counter counter = new Counter();
    
            Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
                for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                    counter.increment();
                }
            });
    
            Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
                for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                    counter.increment();
                }
            });
    
            t1.start();
            t2.start();
    
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
    
            System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount()); // Should be 2000
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
- In this example, the `increment()` method is synchronized to ensure that the shared variable `count` is safely updated by both threads.

### 5. **Synchronized Blocks**

- A **synchronized block** allows you to synchronize only a specific portion of the code rather than the entire method, giving you more fine-grained control over the critical section.
- When a thread enters a synchronized block, it must acquire the lock on the specified object (also known as the **monitor object**) before executing the code inside the block.
- Example:
    
    ```java
    class Counter {
        private int count = 0;
    
        public void increment() {
            synchronized (this) {  // Synchronizing on the current object
                count++;
            }
        }
    
        public int getCount() {
            return count;
        }
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            Counter counter = new Counter();
    
            Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
                for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                    counter.increment();
                }
            });
    
            Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
                for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                    counter.increment();
                }
            });
    
            t1.start();
            t2.start();
    
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
    
            System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());  // Should be 2000
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
- In this example, only the critical section inside the `increment()` method is synchronized, allowing more flexibility.

### 6. **Object-Level Lock vs. Class-Level Lock**

- **Object-level lock**: When a method or block is synchronized on `this` or any other object, it locks that specific object.
    - Only one thread can access synchronized code for that specific object.
- **Class-level lock (static synchronization)**: When a method or block is synchronized on the class itself (using `synchronized (ClassName.class)` or a static synchronized method), it locks the class. This is used for static methods.
    - Example of class-level lock (static synchronization):
        
        ```java
        class Counter {
            private static int count = 0;
        
            public static synchronized void increment() {  // Static synchronized method
                count++;
            }
        
            public static int getCount() {
                return count;
            }
        }
        
        public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
                Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
                    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                        Counter.increment();
                    }
                });
        
                Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
                    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                        Counter.increment();
                    }
                });
        
                t1.start();
                t2.start();
        
                t1.join();
                t2.join();
        
                System.out.println("Final count: " + Counter.getCount());  // Should be 2000
            }
        }
        
        ```
        

### 7. **Intrinsic Locks (Monitor)**

- In Java, every object has an intrinsic lock (also called a **monitor**). When a thread enters a synchronized method or block, it acquires the lock associated with that object.
- If another thread tries to enter any synchronized block or method on the same object, it must wait until the first thread releases the lock.
- **Note**: Only methods or blocks marked as `synchronized` are subject to lock acquisition.

### 8. **Reentrant Synchronization**

- Javaâ€™s synchronization is **reentrant**. This means that if a thread has already acquired a lock on an object, it can re-enter any synchronized method or block on the same object without any issue.
- This prevents **deadlock** within a single thread.
- Example:
    
    ```java
    class A {
        public synchronized void method1() {
            System.out.println("Method 1");
            method2();  // Re-entering a synchronized method on the same object
        }
    
        public synchronized void method2() {
            System.out.println("Method 2");
        }
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            A obj = new A();
            obj.method1();
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
- Output:
    
    ```
    Method 1
    Method 2
    
    ```
    

### 9. **Thread Interference and Race Conditions**

- **Thread interference** happens when multiple threads attempt to modify shared resources concurrently without proper synchronization, leading to **race conditions**.
- A **race condition** occurs when the outcome of a program depends on the interleaving of operations by different threads and is typically caused by unsynchronized access to shared data.
- Example of a race condition (without synchronization):
    
    ```java
    class Counter {
        private int count = 0;
    
        public void increment() {
            count++;  // Race condition
        }
    
        public int getCount() {
            return count;
        }
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            Counter counter = new Counter();
    
            Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
                for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                    counter.increment();

### 10. **Inter-Thread Communication**

- Java provides methods like `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` to allow threads to communicate and cooperate with each other.
- **wait()**: Causes the current thread to release the lock and wait until another thread calls `notify()` or `notifyAll()`.
- **notify()**: Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on the objectâ€™s lock.
- **notifyAll()**: Wakes up all threads waiting on the objectâ€™s lock.
- These methods must be called within a synchronized context.

Example:

```java
class SharedData {
    private boolean dataReady = false;

    public synchronized void produce() {
        System.out.println("Producing data...");
        dataReady = true;
        notify();  // Notify waiting threads
    }

    public synchronized void consume() throws InterruptedException {
        while (!dataReady) {
            wait();  // Wait for data to be produced
        }
        System.out.println("Consuming data...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        SharedData sharedData = new SharedData();

        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            sharedData.produce();
        });

        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                sharedData.consume();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });

        consumer.start();
        producer.start();

        consumer.join();
        producer.join();
    }
}

```

Thread synchronization in Java is crucial for ensuring that multiple threads can operate on shared data safely without leading to data inconsistency or race conditions. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of thread synchronization, including its purpose, mechanisms, and examples.

### Overview of Thread Synchronization

1. **Definition**: Thread synchronization is a mechanism that ensures that two or more concurrent threads do not simultaneously execute some particular program segment, especially when they share resources like variables or data structures.
2. **Need for Synchronization**:
    - **Race Conditions**: Occur when two threads try to update a shared resource at the same time.
    - **Data Inconsistency**: Can lead to unpredictable results when multiple threads read and write shared data.
    - **Thread Safety**: Ensures that a resource is accessed by only one thread at a time.

### Mechanisms for Synchronization

1. **Synchronized Methods**: You can declare a method to be synchronized using the `synchronized` keyword. This allows only one thread to execute that method on the same object instance.
2. **Synchronized Blocks**: For more fine-grained control, you can synchronize a block of code inside a method. This reduces the scope of synchronization to just the code that needs it.
3. **Locks**: Java provides explicit locking using the `Lock` interface found in the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package. This offers more flexibility and capabilities than synchronized methods or blocks.
4. **Volatile Keyword**: The `volatile` keyword can be used to indicate that a variable's value will be modified by different threads. This ensures visibility of changes to variables across threads.
5. **Thread.join()**: Although not a synchronization mechanism per se, `join()` can be used to ensure that one thread waits for another to finish execution.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating thread synchronization using both synchronized methods and synchronized blocks:

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Synchronized method to safely increment the count
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    // Synchronized block for finer control
    public void incrementWithBlock() {
        synchronized (this) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

class CounterThread extends Thread {
    private Counter counter;

    public CounterThread(Counter counter) {
        this.counter = counter;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            counter.increment(); // Calling synchronized method
            // counter.incrementWithBlock(); // Alternatively, use the synchronized block
        }
    }
}

public class SynchronizationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        CounterThread thread1 = new CounterThread(counter);
        CounterThread thread2 = new CounterThread(counter);

        // Start both threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        // Wait for both threads to finish
        thread1.join();
        thread2.join();

        // Print the final count
        System.out.println("Final Count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Counter Class**:
    - Contains a `count` variable that is incremented by multiple threads.
    - The `increment()` method is synchronized to prevent concurrent modifications.
- **CounterThread Class**:
    - Extends `Thread` and takes a `Counter` instance as a parameter.
    - In its `run()` method, it increments the counter 1000 times.
- **SynchronizationExample Class**:
    - Creates a `Counter` instance and two `CounterThread` instances.
    - Starts both threads and waits for them to complete using `join()`.
    - Finally, it prints the final count.

### Key Points to Remember

1. **Performance**: Synchronization can introduce overhead. Itâ€™s essential to synchronize only the critical sections of code to minimize the performance impact.
2. **Deadlock**: Care must be taken to avoid deadlocks, which occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release locks.
3. **Thread Safety**: Classes that are designed for concurrent access should be thread-safe, meaning that they function correctly even when multiple threads access them simultaneously.
4. **Concurrent Collections**: Java also provides concurrent collection classes (like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, etc.) that are designed to handle synchronization internally, making them easier to use in multi-threaded environments.

By understanding and implementing thread synchronization properly, you can create robust and reliable multi-threaded applications in Java.
