### java architecture

the two main component are JVM and java API 

### JVM

The client application or OS must have java byte code interpreter to execute byte code instructions the interpreter is part of JVM bytecode is a standard machine independent low level bytecode files are loaded and interpreted at client machine by a specific program called JVM

JVM interpreter bytecode into native code or machine specific code and is available on platform that support java

**What is the JVM?**

The JVM is a software program that executes Java bytecode. It's essentially a virtual machine that operates within your actual computer's operating system. Java code is first compiled into bytecode, a platform-independent intermediate representation. This bytecode can then be run on any platform with a JVM installed.

**Why is the JVM Important?**

The JVM is central to Java's principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA). Since Java code is compiled into bytecode, it doesn't need to be directly translated into machine code specific to a particular operating system. The JVM interprets the bytecode and ensures it runs properly on the underlying hardware, regardless of the system it's on (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.).

**How Does the JVM Work?**

The JVM consists of several components that work together to execute Java programs:

- **Class Loader:** Loads class files (containing bytecode) into memory when needed.
- **Bytecode Interpreter:** Decodes and executes the bytecode instructions one by one.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler (Optional):** Improves performance by dynamically translating frequently used bytecode into machine code for the specific system.
- **Java Heap:** Memory area where objects are stored and managed during program execution.
- **Java Stack:** Manages method calls and local variables during program execution.
- **Garbage Collector:** Automatically reclaims memory from unused objects, preventing memory leaks.

**Benefits of the JVM:**

- **Platform Independence:** Enables Java code to run on various platforms without modification.
- **Security:** The JVM provides a layer of security by restricting direct access to system resources and memory.
- **Performance:** The JIT compiler can improve performance by optimizing frequently used code.
- **Portability:** Java applications can be easily moved between different systems with a JVM.

### what actually JVM does

It validate the requested the white code verifying  that they pass various formatting and security checks this is a security feature known as byte code verifier.

It allocates memory for the incoming java  class files and guarantees that the security of JVM is not violated , this feature is known as class loader.

It interpret white code instruction found in the class file to execute the program.

### JDK

JDK comes with a collection of tools that are used for development and running java programs.

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software package that provides the tools and libraries necessary for developing Java applications. It's essentially an essential toolkit for Java programmers. Here's a breakdown of what the JDK includes and its functionalities:

**Components of the JDK:**

- **Java compiler (javac):** This tool takes human-readable Java source code (.java files) and translates it into bytecode, an intermediate representation that the JVM can understand.
- **Java Archive tool (jar):** This tool packages class files (containing bytecode) and other resources (like images or configuration files) into a single archive file (.jar file). JAR files are a convenient way to distribute and manage Java libraries and applications.
- **Java debugger (jdb):** This tool helps identify and troubleshoot errors in your Java code during development.
- **Java documentation tool (javadoc):** This tool generates API documentation from your Java source code, explaining classes, methods, and variables, which is helpful for understanding and using your code or libraries.
- **Standard Java API Libraries:** The JDK includes a rich set of pre-written classes and functionalities that developers can leverage in their applications. These libraries cover various functionalities like input/output operations, networking, collections, user interface components (for Swing and JavaFX applications), and more.

**What can you do with the JDK?**

- **Write Java programs:** Compile Java source code into bytecode that the JVM can execute.
- **Create JAR files:** Package your compiled classes and resources for distribution or use in other applications.
- **Debug Java code:** Identify and fix errors in your programs using the debugger.
- **Generate API documentation:** Create documentation to explain your code and improve collaboration.
- **Access standard Java libraries:** Utilize pre-built functionalities for common tasks in your applications.

**Obtaining the JDK:**

The JDK is freely available for download from Oracle's website: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

**Who needs the JDK?**

Anyone who wants to develop Java applications needs the JDK. This includes:

- **Professional Java programmers:** Building enterprise applications, web applications, mobile apps (primarily for Android development using Java), or other types of Java software.
- **Students learning Java:** Practicing and experimenting with Java programming during their studies.
- **Anyone interested in Java development:** The JDK provides the tools to get started with creating Java applications.

**Relationship between JDK, JVM, and JRE:**

- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Provides the tools for developing Java applications (compiler, libraries, etc.).
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** The software that executes Java bytecode. It's installed separately and is required to run any Java program, regardless of whether it was developed with the JDK.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** A subset of the JDK that includes only the JVM and essential libraries needed to run Java programs. It does not include the development tools (compiler, debugger, etc.) found in the JDK.

### features of java

**Object-Oriented:**

- Everything in Java revolves around objects, promoting code reusability and modularity.

**Platform Independent (WORA):**

- Java code is compiled into bytecode that can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). (Write Once, Run Anywhere)

**Robust and Secure:**

- Automatic garbage collection prevents memory leaks.
- Strong typing and exception handling enhance code reliability.
- Secure runtime environment due to applet sandboxing and restrictions.

**Simple and Easy to Learn:**

- Java syntax is similar to C++, making it easier to pick up for programmers familiar with those concepts.
- Large online community and abundant resources.

**High Performance:**

- Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation optimizes frequently used code.
- Rich API libraries reduce development time and effort.

**Multithreaded:**

- Supports concurrent execution of multiple tasks for improved responsiveness.

```java
public class first
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
System.out.printn("hello world");
}
}
```

public is the access specifier , void is the return type , 

**1. Variables:**

- Containers that hold data while a program runs.
- Must be declared with a data type before use.
- Example: `int age = 25;` (declares an integer variable `age` and assigns the value 25)

**2. Data Types:**

- Specify the type of data a variable can hold (e.g., numbers, characters, text).
- Common data types:
    - **Primitive:** Basic data types like `int` (integers), `double` (floating-point numbers), `char` (characters), `boolean` (true/false).
    - **Non-primitive:** Reference types like `String` (text), objects created from classes.

**3. Data Members (Class Members):**

- Variables defined within a class to represent its properties or characteristics.
- Example: `class Person { String name; int age; }` (defines `name` and `age` as data members of the `Person` class)

**4. Methods (Class Members):**

- Functions defined within a class that encapsulate specific actions or behaviors.
- Can access and manipulate the data members of the class.
- Example: `class Person { ... public void greet() { System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name); } }` (defines a `greet` method that prints a greeting using the `name` data member)
