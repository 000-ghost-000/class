# class & object

### Class and Object in Java

### 1. **Class**

A class in Java is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

**Syntax:**

```java
class ClassName {
    // Attributes (fields)
    dataType attributeName;

    // Constructor
    ClassName(parameters) {
        // Initialization code
    }

    // Methods
    returnType methodName(parameters) {
        // Method body
    }
}

```

**Example:**

```java
public class Car {
    // Attributes
    String model;
    String color;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String model, String color, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Model: " + model);
        System.out.println("Color: " + color);
        System.out.println("Year: " + year);
    }
}

```

**Key Points:**

- A class can contain fields (variables) and methods to define the behavior of the objects.
- Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects.
- The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current object instance.

### 2. **Object**

An object is an instance of a class. It is created using the `new` keyword followed by the class constructor.

**Syntax:**

```java
ClassName objectName = new ClassName(parameters);

```

**Example:**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of the Car class
        Car myCar = new Car("Tesla", "Red", 2021);

        // Calling a method on the object
        myCar.displayInfo();
    }
}

```

**Key Points:**

- An object is created using the `new` keyword.
- Objects have state and behavior: state is represented by the values of its attributes, and behavior is represented by its methods.
- You can create multiple objects from a single class, each with different attribute values.

### 3. **Encapsulation**

Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping the data (attributes) and code (methods) together as a single unit. In Java, this is achieved by declaring the fields as private and providing public getter and setter methods to access and update the values.

**Example:**

```java
public class Person {
    // Private fields
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Public getter for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Public setter for name
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Public getter for age
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Public setter for age
    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}

```

**Key Points:**

- Encapsulation helps protect the internal state of the object.
- It provides controlled access to the attributes via getters and setters.

### 4. **Inheritance**

Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (child/subclass) inherits the attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass). It allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships.

**Example:**

```java
public class Animal {
    // Method in superclass
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    // Method in subclass
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.eat();  // Inherited method
        myDog.bark(); // Method of Dog class
    }
}

```

**Key Points:**

- The `extends` keyword is used to inherit from a class.
- Subclasses inherit fields and methods from the superclass.
- Subclasses can override superclass methods to provide specific implementation.

### 5. **Polymorphism**

Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

**Example of Method Overriding:**

```java
public class Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Some generic animal sound");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.makeSound(); // Outputs "Bark"
    }
}

```

**Key Points:**

- Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
- Polymorphism enables flexibility and the ability to extend code without modifying existing code.

By understanding these fundamental concepts of classes and objects in Java, you can create robust and reusable code.
