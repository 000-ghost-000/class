# file system vs DBMS

### File System Fundamentals:

A file system is a hierarchical data structure that organizes files and folders on a storage device like a hard drive or solid-state drive. It provides a way to:

- **Store and manage files:** Files contain data of various types (documents, images, videos, etc.).
- **Organize files and folders:** Folders (directories) group related files for better management.
- **Access and manipulate files:** The file system provides mechanisms for reading, writing, deleting, renaming, and searching for files.

**Key Components:**

- **Files:** Units of storage that contain data.
- **Folders (Directories):** Containers that organize files hierarchically (subfolders can be created within folders).
- **Path:** Specifies the location of a file or folder within the file system structure. (e.g., C:\Users\username\Documents\myfile.txt)
- **Attributes:** Information associated with files and folders, like size, creation date, access permissions (who can read, write, or modify).

**Common Operations:**

- **Create:** Create new files and folders.
- **Read:** Access the contents of a file.
- **Write:** Modify the contents of a file.
- **Delete:** Remove files or folders.
- **Rename:** Change the name of a file or folder.
- **Move:** Change the location of a file or folder within the file system.
- **Copy:** Create a duplicate of a file or folder.

**File System Types:**

- **Hierarchical:** Most common type, organizes files and folders in a tree-like structure.
- **Flat:** Less common, all files reside at the same level without folders.
- **Network File System (NFS):** Allows shared access to files across a network.

Common tasks:

- Create, read, write, and delete files.
- List directory contents.
- Get file attributes.
- Navigate the file system structure.

### difference between file system and DBMS

| Feature | File System | DBMS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | General data storage and organization | Manage structured data in a centralized way |
| Data Structure | Hierarchical (folders & files) | Tables with schema (columns & rows) |
| Data Management | Basic file operations (CRUD) | Advanced data manipulation & querying |
| Scalability | Limited for large datasets | Designed for scalability |
| Performance | Varies depending on file size & location | Optimized for fast data retrieval |
| Security | Relies on OS permissions | User access control & data encryption |

## Problems with Using a File System as a Database

While file systems are efficient for storing and organizing files, they fall short when used as a database for managing structured data. Here are some key problems:

### Data Redundancy and Inconsistency

- **Duplication:** The same data may be stored in multiple files, leading to wasted space and potential inconsistencies.
- **Updates:** Maintaining data integrity across multiple files becomes challenging, as changes need to be made in all instances.

### Lack of Data Independence

- **Data Dependence:** Applications become tightly coupled with the file structure, making it difficult to modify or restructure data.
- **Limited Flexibility:** File systems are not designed for complex data relationships and queries.

### Security and Access Control

- **Limited Security:** File systems offer basic access controls, but they lack robust security features found in databases.
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information stored in plain text files can be vulnerable to unauthorized access.

### Performance Issues

- **Slow Retrieval:** Searching and retrieving specific data can be inefficient, especially for large datasets.
- **Concurrency Issues:** Multiple users accessing and modifying files simultaneously can lead to data corruption or conflicts.

### Lack of Data Integrity and Consistency

- **Data Validation:** File systems lack built-in mechanisms for data validation and integrity checks.
- **Transaction Support:** File systems do not support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties required for reliable data management.

### Difficulty in Managing Complex Data Relationships

- **Limited Structure:** File systems struggle to represent complex relationships between data entities.
- **Query Complexity:** Retrieving related data often requires custom programming and complex file manipulations.
