# extended ER diagram

EER diagram has some extended features of ER diagram it is also known as an enhanced ER diagram 

EER includes the following concept 

- subclass and superclass
    - using this concept any class can be further divided into subclasses, eg - class shape can be further divided as square, circle, and triangle here shape is a superclass and square circle and triangle are subclasses
- specialization and generalization

    - generalization is a process of generalizing any entity while doing this common attributes of generalized entities are collected it is a bottom-up approach
    - consider entity faculty FID

the concept of specialization is the reverse of the generalization concept and this concept gives specialization to some specific entities, this is a top-down approach 

let's consider an employee who has their id name salary which can be further specialized in different types of employees 

- union

union operation the given set of entities is collected according to the union parameter 

eg - car and truck are two entity sets and they can go to the union operation for registered vehicles 

- aggregation

it is a concept in which the connection between two entities is considered as one unified entity it includes combining the relationship with their respective entities into a better degree entity
