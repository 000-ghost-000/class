# concurrency control

### 1. Introduction to Concurrency Control

- **Concurrency Control** in DBMS ensures that multiple transactions can execute simultaneously without violating data integrity and consistency. The mechanism prevents anomalies that may arise from concurrent execution, such as lost updates, temporary inconsistencies, and uncommitted data.
- The main objectives are to:
    1. **Maintain Data Integrity**: Ensure that database constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys) are not violated.
    2. **Provide Isolation**: Prevent the operations of one transaction from interfering with others.
    3. **Improve System Performance**: Enable higher throughput by allowing multiple transactions to execute concurrently.

### 2. Lock-Based Protocols

- **Locks** are tools for controlling access to data in concurrent transactions.
- There are two primary lock types:
    1. **Exclusive (X) Lock**:
        - Allows the transaction holding the lock to read and write the data item.
        - No other transaction can hold any lock on the item when an X-lock is active.
    2. **Shared (S) Lock**:
        - Allows multiple transactions to read the data item concurrently.
        - Does not permit write operations while the S-lock is held.
- **Lock Compatibility Matrix**:
    - Used to determine if a lock request can be granted.
    - Matrix Rules:
        - S-Lock + S-Lock = Compatible (Multiple shared locks allowed).
        - S-Lock + X-Lock = Incompatible (An exclusive lock request conflicts with an existing shared lock).
        - X-Lock + X-Lock = Incompatible (Only one exclusive lock can be held at a time).

### 3. Locking Protocols

- A **locking protocol** defines how transactions should request and release locks.
- **Basic Example**:
    - T2 performs: `lock-S(A)` → `read(A)` → `unlock(A)` → `lock-S(B)` → `read(B)` → `unlock(B)` → `display(A + B)`.
    - This protocol may not ensure serializability if other transactions update A or B between the reads.
- **Locking Protocol Rules**:
    - Must be designed to avoid non-serializable schedules.
    - Prevents situations like **dirty reads**, **uncommitted data**, and **lost updates**.

### 4. Two-Phase Locking (2PL) Protocol

- **2PL Protocol** ensures **conflict-serializable** schedules by splitting the transaction into two phases:
    1. **Growing Phase**:
        - The transaction can acquire locks but cannot release any.
        - It continues to request locks as needed.
    2. **Shrinking Phase**:
        - Once the transaction starts releasing locks, it cannot request any new ones.
- **Serializability** is guaranteed because the order in which transactions acquire locks determines the serial order.
- **Types of 2PL**:
    1. **Strict Two-Phase Locking (Strict 2PL)**:
        - Holds all exclusive locks until the transaction commits or aborts.
        - Ensures **cascadeless schedules**.
    2. **Rigorous Two-Phase Locking**:
        - All locks (both shared and exclusive) are held until the transaction commits or aborts.
        - Provides a higher level of isolation but may reduce concurrency.

### 5. Lock Conversions in 2PL

- **Lock conversion** allows for switching between different lock modes:
    - During the **growing phase**, a shared lock can be upgraded to an exclusive lock if the transaction needs to write to the data item.
    - In the **shrinking phase**, an exclusive lock can be downgraded to a shared lock if no further writes are needed.
- This approach offers greater flexibility but must be carefully managed to avoid inconsistencies.

### 6. Deadlocks

- **Deadlock** arises when transactions form a cycle of dependencies, where each transaction waits for a resource held by another.
    - **Example**: Transaction T3 has a lock on resource A and waits for resource B, while T4 holds a lock on B and waits for A.
- **Symptoms of Deadlocks**:
    1. Transactions are stuck waiting indefinitely.
    2. The system appears to be frozen due to circular waiting.

### 7. Deadlock Handling Techniques

- **Deadlock Prevention**:
    1. **Predeclaration**: Transactions declare all required resources before execution.
    2. **Resource Ordering**: Impose a partial order on resources and acquire them in a specific sequence to avoid circular waiting.
- **Deadlock Detection**:
    - Implement a **wait-for graph** where nodes represent transactions, and directed edges indicate waiting relationships.
    - **Deadlock Detection Algorithm** periodically checks for cycles in the wait-for graph.
- **Deadlock Recovery**:
    - **Victim Selection**: Choose a transaction to roll back based on criteria like the number of resources held, the time spent waiting, or the cost of rollback.
    - **Rollback Types**:
        - **Total Rollback**: Restart the transaction from the beginning.
        - **Partial Rollback**: Roll back only enough to break the deadlock.

### 8. Advanced Deadlock Prevention Techniques

- **Wait-Die Scheme**:
    - An older transaction (lower timestamp) waits for a younger transaction, while a younger one is aborted if it waits for an older.
- **Wound-Wait Scheme**:
    - An older transaction preempts a younger transaction by aborting it.
    - A younger transaction waits if an older one holds the lock.
- **Timeout-Based Schemes**:
    - A transaction waits only for a limited time for a lock before being rolled back.
    - **Pros**: Simple implementation.
    - **Cons**: Potential for starvation and difficulty in setting a suitable timeout.

### 9. Multiple Granularity Locking

- Supports locking data items at different granularities, such as database, file, or record levels.
- **Granularity Hierarchy**: Coarse levels (e.g., database) encompass finer levels (e.g., records).
- **Types of Intention Locks**:
    1. **Intention-Shared (IS)**: Indicates shared locking will occur at a lower level.
    2. **Intention-Exclusive (IX)**: Indicates exclusive locking at a lower level.
    3. **Shared and Intention-Exclusive (SIX)**: Combines shared locking at the higher level and exclusive at the lower.
- **Lock Escalation**: Switch to a higher granularity lock (e.g., from record to file level) to reduce lock overhead.

### 10. Timestamp-Based Protocols

- Transactions are assigned **timestamps** based on their start times, determining their order.
- **Timestamp Ordering Rules**:
    - **Read Rule**: A transaction can read a data item if its timestamp is greater than the write timestamp of the data item.
    - **Write Rule**: A transaction can write if its timestamp is later than both the read and write timestamps of the data item.
- **Benefits**: Ensures conflict serializability.
- **Drawbacks**: May lead to frequent rollbacks if timestamps conflict.

### 11. Validation-Based Protocol (Optimistic Concurrency Control)

- Assumes conflicts are rare; transactions are executed in the hope of no conflicts.
- **Three Phases**:
    1. **Read Phase**: Transactions read and write to local variables.
    2. **Validation Phase**: Checks if the changes conflict with other transactions.
    3. **Write Phase**: Commits the changes to the database if validation succeeds.
- **Advantages**: Works well in low-conflict environments.
- **Disadvantages**: High overhead if conflicts are frequent.

### 12. Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC)

- **Multiversion schemes** store multiple versions of a data item to avoid locking delays.
- **Multiversion Timestamp Ordering**:
    - Maintains a separate version for each timestamp.
    - Selects the appropriate version of a data item based on the transaction’s timestamp.
- **Multiversion Two-Phase Locking**:
    - Combines multiversion storage with traditional locking techniques for enhanced concurrency.
