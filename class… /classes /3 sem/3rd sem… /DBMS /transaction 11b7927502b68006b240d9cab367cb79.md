# transaction

### 1. Transaction Concept

- A **transaction** is defined as a logical unit of work consisting of a sequence of operations that perform a single task within a database system. It includes one or more database operations such as reading, writing, updating, or deleting data.
- Transactions ensure the **consistency and integrity** of the database.
- **Example Scenario**: Transferring $50 from account A to account B:
    1. **Read(A)**: Retrieve the balance of account A.
    2. **A := A - 50**: Subtract $50 from account A's balance.
    3. **Write(A)**: Update the balance of account A in the database.
    4. **Read(B)**: Retrieve the balance of account B.
    5. **B := B + 50**: Add $50 to account B's balance.
    6. **Write(B)**: Update the balance of account B in the database.
- **Key Issues**:
    1. **Failures**: Handling unexpected events like hardware failures, power outages, software bugs, or system crashes to ensure the database remains consistent.
    2. **Concurrency Control**: Managing the execution of multiple transactions simultaneously while preserving data integrity.

### 2. Required Properties of a Transaction (ACID Properties)

- **Atomicity**:
    - The principle that a transaction should be treated as a single "atomic" unit, meaning all its operations must be completed successfully, or none at all. Partial execution leaves the database in an inconsistent state.
    - The database management system (DBMS) must provide mechanisms for automatic **rollback** if a failure occurs during the transaction's execution.
- **Consistency**:
    - A transaction should transition the database from one valid state to another. The execution of a transaction should not violate the integrity constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, uniqueness).
    - **Example Consistency Requirement**: In the transaction transferring $50 from A to B, the total balance (A + B) must remain unchanged before and after the transaction.
    - This involves validating constraints and rules both **before** (pre-condition) and **after** (post-condition) the transaction execution.
- **Isolation**:
    - Ensures that transactions operate independently, and the intermediate steps of one transaction are not visible to other concurrently running transactions.
    - Isolation levels can vary to provide different degrees of concurrency. For instance:
        - **Read Uncommitted**: Allows reading uncommitted changes from other transactions.
        - **Read Committed**: Transactions can only read data that has been committed.
        - **Repeatable Read**: Ensures the same data read multiple times remains consistent throughout the transaction.
        - **Serializable**: Provides the highest level of isolation, equivalent to executing transactions serially.
- **Durability**:
    - Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent, even in the event of a subsequent failure.
    - Achieved through **log-based recovery mechanisms**, where all changes are recorded in a log, allowing the system to **redo** or **undo** operations as needed during recovery.

### 3. Transaction States

- **Active**: Initial state, where the transaction is being executed.
- **Partially Committed**: After the final operation is executed, but before the changes are made permanent.
- **Failed**: A problem occurs that prevents the transaction from continuing.
- **Aborted**:
    - The transaction is rolled back, and the database is restored to the state it was in before the transaction began.
    - The transaction can be restarted if no logical errors exist; otherwise, it is permanently stopped.
- **Committed**: The transaction is successfully completed, and changes are saved permanently.

### 4. Schedules in Transactions

- A **schedule** refers to the sequence in which operations from multiple transactions are executed.
- Types of Schedules:
    1. **Serial Schedule**:
        - Each transaction is executed from start to finish without any interleaving of operations.
        - Guarantees consistency but may lead to poor system performance due to lack of concurrency.
    2. **Concurrent Schedule**:
        - Multiple transactions are interleaved, meaning their operations are executed in a mixed order.
        - Allows better resource utilization and system throughput but requires careful management to avoid data inconsistencies.

### 5. Serializability

- **Serializability** is the concept used to ensure that a concurrent schedule of transactions leads to the same results as some serial execution of those transactions.
- **Conflict Serializability**:
    - Two operations from different transactions **conflict** if they access the same data item and at least one of them is a write operation.
    - If a schedule can be transformed into a serial schedule by swapping non-conflicting operations, it is considered conflict serializable.
- **View Serializability**:
    - Transactions are view equivalent if, for each data item, the initial read, intermediate reads, and the final write operations are the same across both schedules.
    - View serializability is broader than conflict serializability, as it accounts for additional scenarios such as blind writes.

### 6. Testing for Serializability

- Uses a **precedence graph** (also known as a dependency graph), where:
    - **Nodes** represent transactions.
    - **Edges** represent conflicts between transactions (directed from one transaction to another based on data access order).
- If the graph is **acyclic**, the schedule is conflict serializable.
- **Cycle Detection** algorithms are used to test for acyclic properties, ranging from simple approaches (O(n^2) time complexity) to more efficient methods (O(n + e), where e is the number of edges).

### 7. Recoverable and Cascadeless Schedules

- **Recoverable Schedules**:
    - A schedule is recoverable if, whenever a transaction reads data written by another transaction, the first transaction must commit before the second one.
- **Cascading Rollbacks**:
    - Occur when a transaction failure causes multiple dependent transactions to be rolled back, undoing a large amount of work.
- **Cascadeless Schedules**:
    - To avoid cascading rollbacks, a transaction can only read data from other transactions that have already committed.
    - Ensures safer recovery mechanisms.

### 8. Concurrency Control

- Ensures the integrity and consistency of data when multiple transactions are processed simultaneously.
- **Concurrency Control Protocols**:
    - **Lock-based protocols**: Transactions must acquire locks before accessing data (shared or exclusive locks).
    - **Timestamp-based protocols**: Each transaction is assigned a timestamp, determining the order of access.
    - **Optimistic concurrency control**: Transactions execute without restrictions but are validated before committing to ensure consistency.

### 9. Conflicting Instructions

- Conflicts arise between instructions from different transactions if they access the same data item, and at least one is a **write**.
- **Types of Conflicts**:
    1. **Read-Read (no conflict)**.
    2. **Read-Write (conflict)**.
    3. **Write-Read (conflict)**.
    4. **Write-Write (conflict)**.

### 10. View Serializability

- More inclusive than conflict serializability.
- Allows for **blind writes**, where transactions modify data without reading it.
