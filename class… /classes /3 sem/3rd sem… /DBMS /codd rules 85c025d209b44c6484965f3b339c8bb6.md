### Codd's 12 Rules for Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)

**Codd's 12 rules** were proposed by Dr. Edgar F. Codd, the pioneer of the relational database model, to define what is required from a database management system to be considered relational, i.e., an RDBMS. These rules ensure the consistency, reliability, and structural integrity of relational databases.

---

### **Foundation Rule: The Relational Model**

- **Definition**: The entire database must be based on the relational model. This rule sets the foundation for all other rules and ensures that the DBMS adheres to relational principles, allowing the system's relational capabilities to manage the data efficiently.
- **Explanation**: It emphasizes that the core of the system must be structured relationally, which implies that data must be stored in tables, and the DBMS should follow relational theory.
- **Significance**: This foundational rule guarantees that data management operations are performed using relational principles.

---

### **Rule 1: The Information Rule**

- **Definition**: All information in a relational database must be represented in the form of data values stored in tables (i.e., in rows and columns).
- **Explanation**: This rule ensures that data is stored in a structured way—every piece of data is recorded in a table (relation), and every row (tuple) represents a record, while every column represents an attribute.
- **Example**: A student database would store each student's details (like ID, name, age) in a table, with each row representing one student and each column representing an attribute like `StudentID`, `Name`, and `Age`.

---

### **Rule 2: The Guaranteed Access Rule**

- **Definition**: Every data item in a relational database must be logically accessible using a combination of table name, primary key, and column name.
- **Explanation**: This rule ensures that any piece of data can be uniquely and directly accessed through its unique identifier (primary key), table name, and column name.
- **Significance**: This allows for a systematic way of retrieving any specific piece of data. It eliminates the need for scanning the entire database.
- **Example**: To retrieve a specific student’s age, you would use the table name `Students`, the column name `Age`, and the student’s primary key (e.g., `StudentID = 123`).

---

### **Rule 3: The Systematic Treatment of Null Values**

- **Definition**: The handling of null values must be uniform. A null value in a relational database represents missing, unknown, or inapplicable data.
- **Explanation**: This rule enforces a systematic and consistent treatment of null values. Null values cannot be used in place of a valid primary key (which must be unique and not null).
- **Significance**: It ensures that the database is aware of the distinction between “unknown,” “missing,” or “inapplicable” values, and it handles these cases appropriately during data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Example**: In a `Student` table, if a student's email is unknown, it should be represented by a `null` value. However, the `StudentID` (primary key) cannot be `null`.

---

### **Rule 4: The Dynamic Online Catalog Based on the Relational Model**

- **Definition**: The database must support an online, accessible catalog (or data dictionary) that provides metadata about the structure of the database. The catalog should be accessible via the same query language used to access the database.
- **Explanation**: This rule ensures that a database has a dynamic online catalog (metadata) stored in relational form. The catalog contains data about the tables, columns, constraints, indexes, etc.
- **Significance**: This allows users and administrators to query the catalog for information about the database structure (e.g., to get the names of all tables).
- **Example**: The data dictionary could be queried to list all columns in the `Students` table by using SQL commands like `SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'Students';`.

---

### **Rule 5: The Comprehensive Data SubLanguage Rule**

- **Definition**: A relational database management system must support a comprehensive, non-procedural query language that allows data manipulation, definition, and control.
- **Explanation**: This rule states that the DBMS must provide a language that supports all necessary operations (data manipulation, transaction management, view definition, etc.) and be able to express complex queries.
- **Significance**: This ensures that the DBMS can handle various tasks, including creating tables, querying data, updating records, managing transactions, and enforcing integrity constraints—all via a consistent language, typically SQL.
- **Example**: SQL serves as the comprehensive sublanguage in most RDBMSs. It allows users to define tables (`CREATE TABLE`), manipulate data (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`), and enforce integrity constraints.

---

### **Rule 6: The View Updating Rule**

- **Definition**: All views (virtual tables derived from base tables) should theoretically be updatable, and the DBMS must ensure that updates made through views are reflected in the base tables.
- **Explanation**: A view is essentially a query result that behaves like a table. This rule ensures that if a view is updated, the changes must propagate to the underlying base tables, and the database system should manage this process.
- **Significance**: It allows users to update data through a simpler view, abstracting away the complexity of the base tables.
- **Example**: If a view is created for `SELECT Name, Age FROM Students`, updating the `Age` in the view should update the corresponding row in the `Students` table.

---

### **Rule 7: High-Level Insert, Update, and Delete Rule**

- **Definition**: The DBMS must support set-based (relational-level) operations, meaning users can perform insert, update, and delete operations on sets of data (rows or tables) instead of one row at a time.
- **Explanation**: This rule ensures that relational databases support high-level operations that work on whole sets of rows rather than requiring individual row-by-row manipulation.
- **Significance**: Set-based operations are more efficient and follow the relational model’s principles of working with whole tables or subsets.
- **Example**: Instead of updating one row at a time, you can update multiple rows with a single `UPDATE` statement, e.g., `UPDATE Students SET Age = Age + 1 WHERE GraduationYear = 2024;`.

---

### **Rule 8: Physical Data Independence**

- **Definition**: The physical storage of data should be independent of the applications or users accessing the database.
- **Explanation**: This rule ensures that changes made to the physical storage (e.g., changing how data is indexed or stored on disk) do not affect how applications interact with the data.
- **Significance**: It allows database administrators to optimize the physical storage of data without worrying about breaking applications that rely on the logical structure of the database.
- **Example**: If the physical storage of the `Students` table is changed (e.g., adding a new index), the applications accessing `Students` through SQL queries will continue to function without any changes.

---

### **Rule 9: Logical Data Independence**

- **Definition**: Changes to the logical structure of the database (e.g., adding new columns or splitting tables) should not affect how the data is accessed by applications.
- **Explanation**: This rule ensures that changes at the logical level (like modifying a table's schema) do not disrupt applications or user queries that rely on that schema.
- **Significance**: It provides flexibility for database designers to modify the schema without affecting end-user interactions.
- **Example**: If the `Students` table is split into two tables (`StudentDetails` and `StudentGrades`), applications should still be able to access the data without any disruptions.

---

### **Rule 10: Integrity Independence**

- **Definition**: The integrity constraints of the database (such as primary key, foreign key, and check constraints) should be definable independently of the application logic.
- **Explanation**: This rule ensures that data integrity constraints are enforced by the DBMS itself and not by external applications. This allows integrity rules to be centralized within the database.
- **Significance**: It guarantees data consistency and reliability without relying on application logic to enforce these rules.
- **Example**: The `Students` table may have a `CHECK` constraint to ensure that `Age` is greater than 0. This rule will be enforced regardless of how applications interact with the database.

---

### **Rule 11: Distribution Independence**

- **Definition**: A database should function correctly even if it is distributed across multiple physical locations (i.e., data is stored on different servers).
- **Explanation**: This rule ensures that users can interact with a database as though it were centralized, even if it is distributed across several locations. The location of the data should be transparent to the user.
- **Significance**: It provides the flexibility to scale databases horizontally without impacting the user experience or application functionality.
- **Example**: In a distributed database system, a user querying the `Students` table should not know or care whether the data is stored on one server or multiple servers spread across different locations.

---

### **Rule 12: The Non-Subversion Rule**

- **Definition**: If a system allows access to the database through a lower-level interface, it should not bypass or violate the integrity constraints defined by the higher-level relational model.
- **Explanation**: This rule ensures that any non-relational access methods (like low-level programming languages or APIs) do not violate the integrity constraints enforced by

the relational database.

- **Significance**: It protects the integrity of the database, ensuring that data manipulation done outside of SQL (such as through a backdoor) cannot subvert the relational model’s integrity constraints.
- **Example**: Even if an external application accesses the database through a custom API, it must still respect constraints like foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.

### Summary

Codd’s 12 rules define what it takes for a database system to be considered a **true relational database management system (RDBMS)**. They emphasize data independence, consistency, integrity, and the importance of the relational model. These rules ensure that relational databases are robust, flexible, and capable of handling complex data management tasks efficiently.

- **Foundation Rule** sets the premise of relational data management.
- **Rules 1 to 12** cover everything from the logical structure of data (information, access, and null treatment) to system operations (insert, update, delete) and independence (physical, logical, and integrity).
