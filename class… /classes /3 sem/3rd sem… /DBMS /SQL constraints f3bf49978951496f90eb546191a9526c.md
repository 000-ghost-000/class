# SQL constraints

we have 6 SQL constraints :

```sql
CREATE TABLE sample_table
(
column1 data_type(size) constraint_name,
column2 data_type(size) constraint_name,
column3 data_type(size) constraint_name,
....
);
```

- NOT NULL
    - NULL means empty, i.e., the value is not available.
    Whenever a table's column is declared as NOT NULL, then the value for that column cannot be empty for any of the table's records.
    There must exist a value in the column to which the NOT NULL constraint is applied.
- UNIQUE
    - Duplicate values are not allowed in the columns to which the UNIQUE constraint is applied.
- PRIMARY KEY
    - PRIMARY KEY Constraint is a combination of NOT NULL and Unique constraints.
    - composition of not null and unique
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE d (
    id numeric(1),
    code varchar2(2),
    PRIMARY KEY (id, code));
    ```
    
    ```sql
    create table D (
      ID numeric(1),
      CODE varchar(2),
      constraint PK_D primary key (ID, CODE)
    );
    ```
    
- FOREIGN KEY
- CHECK
    - allows the values of any specific column according to the given rule or policy
- DEFAULT
    - applied on column when we want to set some default values for that column if we do not fill any data for that column

### 1. **NOT NULL Constraint**

**Description:**

- The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that a column cannot have a `NULL` value. This constraint is used when you want to make sure that a particular column always contains data.

**Example Code:**

```sql

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100)
);

```

In this example, `FirstName` and `LastName` columns must contain a value, and they cannot be `NULL`.

---

### 2. **UNIQUE Constraint**

**Description:**

- The `UNIQUE` constraint ensures that all the values in a column (or a group of columns) are distinct. No duplicate values are allowed in the column.

**Example Code:**

```sql
 
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT UNIQUE,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);

```

Here, both `EmployeeID` and `Email` columns must contain unique values. No two employees can have the same `EmployeeID` or `Email`.

---

### 3. **PRIMARY KEY Constraint**

**Description:**

- The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. It is a combination of the `UNIQUE` and `NOT NULL` constraints. A table can only have one primary key, and it ensures that no duplicates and no `NULL` values exist in the column(s).

**Example Code:**

```sql

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100)
);

```

In this example, `EmployeeID` is the primary key, ensuring that it uniquely identifies each employee and cannot be `NULL`.

---

### 4. **FOREIGN KEY Constraint**

**Description:**

- The `FOREIGN KEY` constraint establishes a relationship between two tables. It ensures that the value in one table (child table) corresponds to a value in another table (parent table). It is used to maintain referential integrity.

**Example Code:**

```sql

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
);

```

Here, `DepartmentID` in the `Employees` table is a foreign key referencing `DepartmentID` in the `Departments` table. This ensures that every department ID in the `Employees` table corresponds to an existing department in the `Departments` table.

---

### 5. **CHECK Constraint**

**Description:**

- The `CHECK` constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition. It is used to limit the values that can be placed in a column.

**Example Code:**

```sql

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (Salary > 0)
);

```

In this example, the `Age` column is constrained to values 18 and above, and the `Salary` column must contain positive values.

---

### 6. **DEFAULT Constraint**

**Description:**

- The `DEFAULT` constraint provides a default value for a column if no value is specified during record insertion.

**Example Code:**

```sql

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    JoinDate DATE DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    Status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Active'
);

```

In this example, the `JoinDate` column will automatically take the current date (`GETDATE()`) if no date is provided, and the `Status` column will default to 'Active' unless specified otherwise.

---

### Summary

1. **NOT NULL** - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
2. **UNIQUE** - Ensures all values in a column are unique.
3. **PRIMARY KEY** - A combination of `UNIQUE` and `NOT NULL` ensuring a unique identifier for records.
4. **FOREIGN KEY** - Links two tables together, ensuring referential integrity.
5. **CHECK** - Ensures that values in a column meet a specific condition.
6. **DEFAULT** - Provides a default value for a column when no value is specified.
