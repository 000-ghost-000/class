### Types of Business Activities

Business activities can be categorized into three major types based on the nature of what is being sold: **Product**, **Service**, and **Hybrid**.

### 1. **Product Business**

- **Definition**: A product-based business revolves around the exchange of tangible goods. In this type of business, a seller provides a physical item that can be seen, touched, and owned by the buyer.
- **Example**: A sports shop selling cricket bats, footballs, and other sports equipment. Customers walk in, select an item, pay for it, and take it home.
- **Key Features**:
    - Tangible product
    - Inventory management is crucial
    - Focus on product quality, packaging, and distribution
    - Pricing and supply chain management are key factors
- **Other Examples**:
    - Retail stores (electronics, groceries)
    - Manufacturing businesses (furniture, clothing)

### 2. **Service Business**

- **Definition**: In a service-based business, the seller provides an intangible offering to the buyer, usually in the form of work or expertise that helps the buyer achieve a specific goal or task.
- **Example**: A cricket coaching center where coaches provide training sessions to improve the skills of the players.
- **Key Features**:
    - Intangible service (cannot be touched or stored)
    - Customer experience is crucial
    - Services are often customized based on the client’s needs
    - Less emphasis on inventory, and more on expertise and skills
- **Other Examples**:
    - Consulting firms
    - IT support and software development services
    - Healthcare services (e.g., hospitals, clinics)

### 3. **Hybrid Business**

- **Definition**: A hybrid business combines both product and service elements. It involves selling both tangible products and intangible services to customers.
- **Example**: A sports academy that not only provides coaching services but also sells sports equipment to its trainees and other customers.
- **Key Features**:
    - Offers both goods and services
    - Requires management of both inventory (for products) and workforce (for services)
    - Balancing the quality of both products and services is critical for success
- **Other Examples**:
    - Restaurants: The food (product) is sold while catering or dining services (service) are provided.
    - Automobile dealerships: Selling cars (product) and offering repair or maintenance services (service).
